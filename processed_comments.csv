"1 With all those names you will run out of budget before the filming even starts. <br>2 Stop trying to milk the Avengers, the hype has run dry. Find something else and stop bloating the budget for CGI and actors.<br>3 Pedro Pascal in every movie is causing people movie fatigue faster than the superhero fatigue.<br>4 Junior lost a ton of his popularity and people&#39;s goodwill when he became a sellout and started promoting and speaking about politics in staged avengers calls. He is a great actor but he isn&#39;t your golden goose anymore, realize that.",negative

"Sorry, Marvel. It&#39;s been 15 years, but I&#39;ll still never forgive you for cutting Hank Pym (Ant-Man/Giant Man) and Janet Van Dyne (The Wasp) out of their RIGHTFUL place in the Avengers as founding main characters just to accommodate that overrated lime-squeezer Edgar Wright, who ended up not making a single MCU movie. Who knows if they&#39;ll ever get their due in the MCU?",negative
I still can&#39;t wait for the return of the original X-Men cast from the 2000s. And I&#39;m also looking forward to seeing Hugh reunite with them.,positive

Who is hyped i know i am 🎉😊,positive
I&#39;m am soooooo looking forward to this,positive
I loved X Men Origins Wolverine (2009). I can see Marvel is trying to pretend it never happened but the development of tension between Wolverine and Sabertooth was excellent. Marvel should bring back Liev Schreiber as Sabertooth and give that some respect and closure.,positive
Major goosebumps seeing RDJ at the end!!! I CANNOT WAIT ❤❤❤,positive
New characters please mcu has so much potential but stinks,negative

They should have just put iron man back. Would have been way easier to explain RDJ as Ironman post blip than a RDJ doom. Like it’s breaking the 4th wall kinda confusing for those who still want cannon MCU storylines to continue. Admittedly the multiverse is a mess.,negative

Why does the MCU even matter at this point? Spend 15 years building your own universe only to just ruin it by shoehorning in old non connected Marvel films that have have absolutely NOTHING to do with the MCU!?? I mean why stop at the X-Men. Get rid of the MCU FF, Avengers and Thunderbolts and just have Nicholas Cage, Ben Affleck, Nicholas Hammond, Japanese Spider-Man, Matt Salinger, Wesley Snipes, Jennifer Garner, Dolph Lundgren play these characters. We have Channing Tatum who is nothing more than an SNL skit in Deadpool in Avengers but not Doctor Strange, Moon Knight, Ms Marvel, Kate Bishop, Hawkeye, Captain Marvel. She-Hulk, Spider-Man. This cast sucks. It&#39;s boring. Get rid of the Fox recycled trash and put more MCU characters in it. Hope they die in the first 5 minutes",negative

"I need to know who is in charge of marketing at Marvel. Why the hell do you think this is a good idea? To create hype, they could have done the same thing without the names or with the names censored with tape and it would have had the same impact. By revealing your names they screw up a lot because they ruin the surprise. Like the xmen.",negative

This doesn&#39;t feel the same as endgame. I have no idea what&#39;s going on in the mcu right now. Nothing is connected. None of the heros know each other really. This felt very rushed too. No idea how they&#39;re gonna put it together.,negative

So tired. This is really tired. So no surprises with who is staring in this film. The multiverse and MCU has been DRAGGING ON for half a decade now. Half a decade and still no decent film or plot. Deadpool 3 wasn&#39;t that good. Really did run out of steam.,negative

Love you 3000❤❤❤,positive
"Wow. What an awful way of promoting the new Marvel film. No build up, no assembling the Avengers in previous films, no plan. It&#39;s very last minute. And this film will be a headache to film and probably will convince the remaining actors to drop out of the MCU contract. Or stay because it&#39;s guaranteed work but not good films. I could not be any less excited. How about just making a new X Men film and just end the MCU and rest Marvel films for a few years. The exciting and fun period of the MCU ended last decade. It&#39;s just been Multiverse rubbish this decade. Absolutely awful. &quot;The Boys&quot; even parodied the endless rubbish mcu sequels and spin offs.",negative

They will mess it up! Marvel and DC have no clue what they are doing. They had Captian America Brave New World leak and no one really cared to even watch a pirated version...that isnt good 😔,negative
Ahhh I&#39;m so excited to see this movie 😃🤩🤩,positive
That is such a great way to kick this off!,positive
I can already feel the trying to cram to much in one movie. Thanos was already established which is why infinity war was so successful....you can&#39;t introduce AND build dooms aura in one movie. It will probably be like ultron was. Weak and an embarrassment to what ultron could have been,negative
I&#39;m legitimately excited for the X-Men&#39;s return,positive
JUST THOR AND LOKI MAKES IT THE BEST THING EVER MADE IN LATEST YEARS FROM THE MCU!!!,positive
Channing Tatum is honestly the best part of the entire reveal. So happy they’re keeping him as most likely gambit.,positive

Rebeccaaaaaaaa!! My Mystique ❤❤,positive
Wayy too many characters to be an avengers movie. They need to focus on building the new avengers. And Theyre using the old xmen as nostalgia. Just seems like another multiverse clusterfuck if u ask me.,negative

These movies have gotten so bad that I wont be buying for the first time until the reviews come out. Marvel seems to have given up when it comes to caring about good story telling and caters more to whimsical directors and ceos.,negative

I swear I will RIOT if they kill Loki again...,negative
I think Thor crying over Deadpool was a throw away joke that doesn’t mean anything,negative
if they kill loki then i aint watching anything marvel anymore. ill give up on the mcu forever 😔,negative
I think the final battle will be Loki summoning several people (betting anchor beings) out of the Multiverse to protect him since as far as we know he can&#39;t leave that chair he was sitting in. Doom is probably going to pit the X-Men and Avengers against each other to try and distract them from what he is doing.,negative

They better not open up another Avengers two-movie finale by killing Loki right after he becomes good* again lol. It would be crazy if that exact thing happened twice,negative
Loki better not die. If they kill him again I am DONE with Marvel. Seriously and completely done!,negative
Too much lip service to each character will result in 2 hours of crap.  :(.   I hope I am wrong,negative

He butchered my boy Gambit. Hope he doesn’t get it.,negative
I hope he doesn’t show up as gambit or his version of gambit is killed off asap. He was terrible in Deadpool & wolverine.,negative

Greatest cinematic crossover in history since Infinity War!!,positive

I guess not all actors are complete pieces of shit ...,negative

"Likewise.  I'm happy for him but his gambit isn't the one I imagined, from Jim Lee's run back in the day.  The lanky, agile, and cunning thief",negative
"I doubt any of these actors will be part of the X-men in the coming years after these two Avengers movies.

Feel like there is going to be a reset / soft reboot with the multiverse probably collapsing.",negative
This is a bad take. I thought he stole the show in the scenes he was in,negative
I think that was the point of gambits character in dp&w . He was so terrible that he never actually got a movie and was pruned therefore he was in the void. If Channing is going to be gambit again I’m almost sure he would be portrayed as a more serious and comic faithful interpretation,negative

"I’d love to see a new Ghost Rider in the MCU.

I actually love the Nic Cage films and think they deserve more credit than they get, but I’m also really keen for Marvel to move on from fishing for nostalgia. 

But he’s a cool looking character with a really interesting power set. I love how unnerved people are by his presence. He’s too good to leave on the table.",positive
"I want him back, but I want his second movie to be ignored because it was dogshit.",negative

Matt makes the most sense storytelling-wise,positive
"Disagree. No one knows who Peter Parker is so it is a blank slate for everyone. We don't know what is happening with Doomsday to know if it makes sense or not. I would like to see Daredevil in it, but saying that he is the only one that makes sense is wrong imo.",negative
I sure hope they become buds in the MCU!,positive
"This is your theory?  ""Wanda will be in the movie"" is all you've got?  Don't make some post portraying it like you have some thought out theory about a character and then just say ""She'll be in it.  I really want her to be.""  This is a waste of everyone's time.",negative
"I don’t know that Spider-Man would realistically be in all that much of a rage over him killing Thor. He’s never even interacted with Thor in the MCU. 

Maybe if Doom killed Strange or Happy that could make more sense.",negative
"I haven’t seen Spider-Man share more than two words with Thor in the MCU, yet I’m expected to believe they have such a close relationship that it would trigger Spider-Man to go off like that. While it’s not a terrible sequence, it doesn't fit the character.


Additionally, this shouldn't be the ending. We already know that Tony is Doom. It would only work if we were surprised by the revelation as well.",negative
I would prefer this to be a bit earlier and also Peter and Thor have never really interacted so that would feel kind of weird. Maybe someone Peter is close to like Happy which fits even further with RDJ,negative
"He also reiterated that the rest of the cast haven't been announced yet, but will be revealed soon.",neutral

Shocker!,negative
I know the movie wasn’t great but… where the heck are the Eternals?,negative
Anyone else have a bad feeling about the CGI for this movie? Lots of high paid actors + it’s only a year away and they’re just starting the shooting,negative
The Infinity Saga sold a story. The Multiverse Saga sold a cast. These two Avengers films are going to be a mess that is dependent on nostalgia instead of a good story.,negative

Cap
Thor
Ant-Man
??????",neutral
"The avengers, fantastic 4, the OG XMen, Wakandans and Thunderbolts are going up against Dr Doom and people are complaining it’s not enough.",negative

Can we be done with these fox x-men please,negative
I expect many deaths ,negative
"I’m going to go on a whim here and assume that the X-Men Universe and the MCU will face an incursion triggered by DOOM, which will cause the Fox X-Men universe to die, leading into Secret Wars.",negative
"This sounds so bloated  there are like 4 teams that still haven't even been introduced and we are supposed to make a connection with them in a few 15 minute intervals before a final clash with Doom who also needs to be introduced. They are squeezing way too much into a movie with no setup, even if it is 3 hours long",negative
Is there a plot?,neutral
This shit is so ass,negative
"I really, really hate that we're getting the OG X-men. Just ball up and give us new iterations. You did it with Spiderman, and are doing it with F4.",negative
"In my opinion all of this nostalgia overload they re doing is about to backfire. MoM was cool, NWH was fan service, and now we are here. 

Is anyone else not over it? Ready for a clean break and not wanting to have to go through this to get a fresh X Men, F4 and SM storyline going forward?",negative
I’m sad. If Boseman wa alive we would for sure be getting the Tchalla Reed bromance I love so much 😔,negative
"It's frustrating me how quickly they're moving things along... There's so many characters in this movie we've hardly seen fleshed out, including the main antagonist, and they're already fighting in an Avengers movie. No build up at all",negative
That’s ALL they’re focusing on? They couldn’t fit anymore characters in than that? Pathetic.,negative
"So Dooms just gonna pop out of no where and say “hey i’m bad guy fight me”? Smh 🤦🏻 should have stick with J.Major and Kang story, because they build him up perfectly in Loki and Quantumania.

Honestly they could have add another movie between F4 and Doomsday, to maybe introduce the char first. 10 months of no MCU is such waste.",negative
Sounds good to me,positive
Can't believe they aren't bringing power pack into the MCU for this ensemble.,negative
I am so hyped!,positive
Nevertheless…….*Doom prevails*.,negative
I hope this movie is brutal. Actually have things at stake. The typical hero loses at first then the training montage then they win storyline is boring. I hope marvel moves in the direction of shows like invincible.,negative
Crazy that filming starts in a couple days and it feels like there is no lead up to this.,negative
"This has potential. We've all been hurt before, so I'm not hopeful. 8 years ago, i'd be looking for any leaks, secret news, minor interviews...",negative
I just don’t see how they’re going to come anywhere close to the Infinity Saga.,negative
"All this hype, hope it doesn't disappoint",positive
That doesn't sound like focus,negative
"I have some doubts on this movie. The previous movies didn't really build up the characters that well, mostly becoming a joke.",negative
"> Doomsday will involve protagonists superheroes fighting Doom

Damn, what a shock",negative
"I really don't understand how we can be expected to fear or get excited about doom because we literally had 0 build up of him.

Thanos was teased, HARD for years, and when he finally came around it made sense and was exciting, shame they are not going with doom the same path.

Maybe they are trying something different, giving him a victory in doomsday and rewriting parts of the canon through him and making him a defacto villain for some future even bigger showdown, kind of hard to tell.",negative
this is gonna be great,positive
"damn this movie will basically not have any set up, all the phase 1 and 2 movies felt like they were leading up to infinity war, this is just a random avenger movie with doom on it",negative
Where is it filming?,neutral
All of that with no build up. Literally why did they make the last phase if none of those character would be the major players for this? Shang Chi? Antman? Ms.Marvel & Friends. Who tf is even the Avengers line up right now. Why are they selling tickets on nostalgia teams rather than the ones they made movies for just a few years ago.,negative
"Forgive my ignorance, but is Doom that big of a deal? He seems a little outnumbered here.",negative
I absolutely despise the idea of bringing back the old X-Men. The whole point was to reboot them with the quality of the MCU. That damn Deadpool movie has rotted their brains.,negative
"I'm someone that always rolled his eyes at complaints about casts being too big.

Same thing about superhero fatigue.

But after stopping diehard following the MCU after Endgame, this just seems like a mess. Like Marvel jumped the shark and now is ""forced"" to throw everything in these Avengers movies. Not just Avengers anymore. 

I'm not against multiverse stories, but the way the MCU seems to be doing it seems like a convoluted mess.",negative
there is no reality in which this film is not a giant mess,negative
So whats the official Avengers team at this point?,neutral
"Not the Wakandans being considered their own team 🤣 It’s an entire country, just make a team out of our favorites and let that poor country stop suffering.",negative
How about stop announcing stuff.,negative
Sucks that they keep spoiling it. Miss when I would go to theatre with little information about the movie. It hasn’t even started filming yet.,negative
Short term nostalgia to use the original X-Men but you can't build a new franchise around them. This is a bad move.,negative
Damn I was 90% right based on the cast reveal. Only thing I missed was Waknda being separate. Assumed they’d just be with the Avengers and it would be the perspective of the three earths getting Doomed,negative
Probably comic con or twitter,neutral
"""Fcuk this place in particular"" every big bad in mcu.",negative
the fuck did the wakandans do to doom did T'Challa fuck his wife like johnny did in the comics or something,negative
Is it in Wakanda??,neutral

Professor X is gonna die again 😭,negative
"Yeah maybe they'll just be fodder but having a focus on the Wakandans, besides Shuri of course, seems like a waste of time when the new avengers team, Doom, the fantastic four, and X men need to be developed in this movie",negative
Intermission is for pussies,negative
"Hope so, FOX Cyclops sucks ass, I want the real Scott Summers and not a 50 yo bum.",negative
Which is exactly why I loved the Avengers movies before. Very exciting.,positive
I think it's great they are holding back a main X-Men movie until after all this. The multiversal bend to the saga could be a really great way for Marvel to give the Fox X-Men the send off they deserve and then usher in a new dawn of Marvel led X-Men movies.,positive
So classic!,positive
I'm so tired of the Fox X-Men. It feels like no matter what happens they never go away.,negative
I feel like they will kill em off in this movie.,negative
That’s what I want to know too. The MCU probs regrets killing iron man and Steve Rogers,negative
It's going to be a huge clumsy mess. Kind of interested to see whatever the fuck this turns out to be.,negative
who says its no build up?  still have FF and TB plus it could built from things already released now too,neutral
"It seems a lot of these pieces should have been in place by the end of Phase 4 at least, why Thunderbolts in particular didn't cap off Phase 4 when all the pieces had been introduced and the franchise was in need of some synergy is baffling to me",negative
It's so weird. The classic X-Men people coming back feels like Marvel doesn't know how to bring it all together anymore. Gotta use those nostalgia X-Men as a crutch and an RDJ comeback because they're not sure how to Avenge & cinematic universe. All it does is make me underwhelmed.,negative
"All people complained about for the last three years was ""it isn't going anywhere"" and now it's going ""too fast.""  Make up your minds.",negative
Facts I don’t get why dr doom wasn’t built up from the beginning of phase 4 since the secret wars story is literally built around him being the villain. They should never have wasted time trying to build up Kang just to move to doom midway through.,negative
20 minutes F4 Post Credit scene inbound,neutral
More or less what happened in Infinity War. People really overestimate how much Thanos was built up prior to then. Especially for the general casual audience,negative
Did everyone just suddenly forget what J. Majors did and how much of a piece of shit he is?,negative
Uhh their chairs were in the announcement,neutral
"I'm guessing they will have just formed off screen, I'm worried this movie is gonna juggle way too much",negative
Marvel will never return to Kang. Quantumania was an embarrassment for Marvel and that's the last thing you'd want to remind people about.,negative
"If you think the movie is already spoiled for you then I don’t know what to tell you. 

Not only get off the internet, but maybe just stop existing until the film comes out.",negative
Is that considered soon tho? Comic con is months away,neutral
"Why is everyone so desperate for Spider-Man to be in Doomsday???

It seems really clear he wouldn’t be as his movie is coming out in between Doomsday and secret wars and it’d make no sense to have him pop home to have his own adventure in between what’s being set up as a two parter similar to Infinity War and Endgame 

Plus he seems like he’s supposed to be going back to his role as the friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man as opposed to world saving Spider-Man",negative
Unfortunately that’s not the case. The McU is absolutely afraid of using ny for some reason. IMO 60-80% of all marvel stories should take place in NYC and it’s a shame how even the spiderman movies feel the need to take vacations,negative
"Oh my god, they killed Xavier!


You bastards!",negative
"Actually, Dafne Keen is the youngest.",neutral
So it's Battleworld,neutral
"Why do Fantastic Four and X-Men need to be developed when they have their own movies to do that?

And the Avengers shouldn't take that long since it will consist of characters that we're already familiar with.",negative
I have a bladder. ;(,negative
"> a really great way for Marvel to give the Fox X-Men the send off they deserve

Deadpool and Wolverine already did this really well IMO, even had an emotional montage of shots and behind the scenes footage from all of the Fox X-Men movies at the end.",positive
"It’s becoming apparently obvious that the universe our MCU 616 is set to collide with is the Fox universe. It’ll be the true, final, send off for the Fox universe. It’ll probably be destroyed",negative
"They don’t “deserve” a send off, those movies were trash and the Fox versions of most characters were absolutely terrible too, if anything this feels like charity.",negative
"As a casual viewer, it certainly doesn’t feel like it. Has Shang Chi even been referenced since 2021? Let alone seen?",negative
"Those are the same complaint. The franchise wasn't taking the time to pay out a proper buildup, so the climax is ramping up out of nowhere.",negative
Facts. It's almost like they couldn't predict that the guy they were making the center piece of the saga was going to face criminal charges and become a PR challenge.,negative
They would never do this but damn it would be fucking crazy,negative
"Thanos was introduced before Infinity War. His first proper appearance was GoTG. That's kind of the problem, they don't seem to build things up now. Its like I think Sentry should at least have had a ment*i*o*n* before now.",negative
"Lmfao when has the MCU ever actually kept a villain as a villain beyond their short term arc?

Thanos made one or two goofy cameos in what if? And honestly prior to infinity war, thanos was merely just a post credit tease.

Doom is going to be a repeat of Thanos, and he’s going to get killed off or replaced with another actor",negative
"Ah yes running away from a lunatic, very much so a piece of shit...",negative
The rumor is that Brand New Day will take place on the Spider-Island segment of Battleworld post Doomsday.,neutral
Kind of missing an ingredient there in the MCU,negative

"Speak for yourself Negative Nancy, I was 10 when the first X-Men movie came out and saw everything that came out after that but Hulk (2003). While I have my complaints about each and every movie, I had fun watching it. I’ll be more than happy to get to see some of the characters one more time.",positive
America or Marvel?,neutral
Movie industry don’t got time to reset and build off of doom after all the unpredictability that was thrown at the studio. Actors getting old. Actors want to move on. Kevin Feige ain’t getting any younger either.,negative
"That’s just not accurate at all. They were doing plenty of build up and then suddenly had to change Gears due to the Majors situation. Why does the internet pretend that didn’t happen? They were clearly and plainly building to a Kang Avengers movie that they had to abandon. 

They had Wong in multiple properties. They clearly were setting up Thunderbolts. They were clearly introducing the Young Avengers. 

It’s just not true.",negative
"I don't even think he'll get replaced with another actor because once RDJ has defined the role in the publics eye, anything else is a hard demotion",negative
".......damn, its already April.",negative
I think He’ll be in secret wars which presumably the Fantastic Four will be in also,neutral
Tom holland be lying….,negative
"Basically all superheroes are American, Russian, or Wakandan. There should be some from other countries as well smh.",negative
That's an awful opinion. They should be setting up the Illuminati in this movie somehow. Make us care about these characters and make them matter in the grand scheme don't just sideline them.,negative
"It’s gonna be a soft reboot, I’m betting. That’s what Secret Wars did. Perfect way to start recasting old roles.",positive
"Well, Deadpool literally said ""the multiverse is over"" and talked about how the MCU has been on a decline since Endgame. Indicating a willingness to move on from a storyline that wasn't working and had to be abandoned due to a *Major* problem.

.....And now we're getting multiversal Doctor Doom and the Fox X-Men again.",negative
"To say nothing of Boseman passing, I really feel like he could have tied this whole thing together and was probably meant to.

And then of course Covid probably fucked up their entire pipeline, I know what it did to my company and we are multiple orders of magnitude smaller than Marvel Studios as an operation.",negative
I'm more referring to Dr. Doom. The Kang situation was tragic for sure but just continuing on like nothing happened is crazy work. Doom deserves better than to just be shoehorned in,negative
"Wow, you’re fucking dense…… Literally everything? They switched to Doom so late in the game cause Johnathan Major’s arrest and everything that followed that.",negative
"I'm a little confused because it seems like you're agreeing with me, i'm saying they're giving Doom too big a debut to later demote him to a smaller scale conflict, its the same reason they wouldn't bring Thanos back, where do you go with him when he killed half the universe?",negative
Or they do a teaser that reveals more cast at Comic Con,neutral
Why does everyone have such a hard on for Spider-Man being completely isolated all the time.  It literally defeats the entire purpose of him being integrated into the mcu,negative
Baffled how this could make any difference whatsoever.,negative
"Yeah, like, this is what they’ve done in every Avengers movie. Now we’re suddenly scared of these movies juggling a big cast and several settings?",negative
I know that dipshit my point was that Kang the conqueror  should’ve never been the main villain to begin with it should’ve been dr doom from the start since he’s always been the main villain of the secret wars story.,negative
Okay that is the best version of that situation I’ve heard so far it would be good as long as it’s only revealed at the very end where he really is,positive
"That fucking ""lone gunslinger"" moment with Wanda before he makes his entrance, my god, such a tiny moment but *so* so good.",positive
I’ve watched it a shameful number of times.,negative
"Well marvel didn’t seem to think he was a great choice because he would still be around if they did. They could have recasted the character if they really wanted to. 

But that doesn’t even matter because a secret wars movie without dr doom doesn’t make sense. That’s like infinity war not having Thanos in it.",negative
"I honestly don't know how you're being down voted for spitting facts ,ok some of it is an opinion but you're still making solid points",negative
"What a wholesome post!
MCU movies started as something my dad and I went to see together until the rest of my family slowly got into them. It will always have a special place in my heart seeing it with my dad/family.
As for post Endgame then trust me there’s been some great stuff still! Spidey- No Way Home, Guardians 3, and Shang Chi have been the highlights for me and for the shows then Wandavision, Loki, and Hawkeye might be my top 3 so far.",positive
"Aww. I love this post!!! My friend did this with her dad who has never seen any of the Marvel movies and they loved it and it turned him into a fan. They even watched all the shows after.

I do have to ask; what hockey game did you go to? Lol! As a hockey fan, I am curious.",positive
"This is awesome. I imagine your dad loved spending time with you just as much as you did with him. Before my mom passed away, we spent every Sunday together watching the Walking Dead as “our Infinity Saga” and those are just moments that you will always be able to reflect on as the better days when things get tough down the road. I hope you guys are able to find a new movie or show and keep the tradition going!",positive

Good she was awful.,negative
I think this is the first time I fully believe an actor when they say they're not going to be in a Marvel movie. They did her so dirty on the X-men films so I have no expectation she'd ever want to go back.,negative
"No actor at this point in time would spoil it with an affirmative. If they're in it, theyre gonna say they havent received a phone call. If they're not in it, theyre also gonna say they havent received the call. The answer is going to be negatory either way. However, most actors would not completely shut down the idea of being in a movie. Either she really legitimately hated her time in the role, or she's bad at lying and overcompensating to cover the truth. 

Either way, you're not gonna get a ""yes"" from any actor whose role hasnt been publicly confirmed by the studio already. The only reasons why interviewers ask is because it's fun to make the actors squirm a little when they have to lie, and because the headline gets clicks.",negative

Because people have constantly asked about her return. Especially in Deadpool and Wolverine. So she’s a fan favorite regardless of what some think of her portrayal as Storm. I thought she was an amazing Storm so I’d be excited to see her back,positive
It’s the writers fault not hers.,negative
She hated being in X-Men and always thought her character deserved a bigger role.,negative
"You say that now, but Im going to be looking for the badger",neutral
"I mean I agree with her. Why is Storm still not in Marvel? Are they taking Black Panther 3 to introduce her? Because I thought she was getting introduced in 2. This whole phase is a jumbled mess and they must’ve planned it out before knowing Disney would acquire fox. Spent so much time on characters people didn’t care about—see terrible movie failures, instead of making xmen and  fantastic 4 top prio.",negative
"She didn't have the presence that Storm from other shows/games has. Berry's take was kind of quiet and mousy, while Rivals or '97 or What If...? had this personality and presence. This woman is a *storm* that is, for the moment, casually walking around until shit pops off.",negative
"Eh, Halle’s material wasn’t great, but she’s also genuinely shaky in the role. Her fake accent in 1 was baaaaad",negative
"Are you stupid? She literally taught us what happens to a toad when it gets hit by lightning. Man, appreciate knowledge.",negative
"That's a fair take.

Disney has a lot of money, but they're not going to break the bank for cameos that will not have a massive impact at the box office. 

Whatever X-Men story they're telling in Doomsday, you don't *need* Berry Storm for it to work. They could just recast her or simply not include her.",negative
“I am not in this movie and I will prove it. Marvel Studios is a shitty company with no good movies. Kevin Feige is a talentless hack that should’ve realized his calling is flipping burgers at Popeyes when he was working on the original X-Men movies. And Popeyes doesn’t even have burgers.”,negative
"I like the woman from Netflix's Lost in Space for the role, Taylor Russle, she's talented and under used.",positive
This is one of my favorite gifs.,positive
Why would storm be in black panther. 3. Just because they’re both African? Storm isn’t from Wakanda.,negative
"Oh yeah, that whole thing was bullshit too. From what I remember, it’s not even technically time travel it’s even worse bullshit, she’s able to put his thoughts into his prior consciousness.",negative
"And they gave insanely bad wardrobe in the first 2 movies, it is puzzling how an actress so attractive can look so bad like when the Senator Kelly arrives at the mansion.",negative
No actor would ever say that even if they actually believed it. Burning the bridge to that Disney bag would be unwise.,negative
"why would she file a lawsuit against disney for people hypothesizing she’s in the movie? or if your point is by filing a lawsuit against Disney she’s showing her separation from them and thus breaking any kind of relationship with them, i would advise you to look at ScarJo and how that does not really mean anything ",negative
She was great in Bones and All.,positive
I'd also argue that Hugh Jackman has the massive advantage of being a white man in an industry that heavily favors people like him. Halle Berry has done so much better with what was made available to her.,positive
"You're either massively biased (putting way too much emphasis on her having a single Oscar from 24 years ago), don't understand what being a ""star"" means, or haven't paid attention to her career post 2003; because basically everything she's been the main headliner for since then has been a critical or financial failure.

She was a star in the late 90s and early 2000s, but her name isn't putting asses in seats anymore and no one gives a shit about what she does.",negative
Which is why First Class was such a breath of fresh air. They teased us good in the movie tho.,positive
"A terrible line to be sure. But imagine the voice actress from X-men the Animated Series saying it? She would lean into the cheesiness,  go over the top and full throttle. IDK if it was shitty direction or lack of caring on her part, but i don't think the line was completely to blame. There are plenty versions of Storm that would have said that godawful line and rocked it, making it memeworthy.",negative
"Really my only complaint with that movie. It made absolutely no sense but I think they just said ""fuck it, let's have Kitty do it"" rather than introduce another character. 

Even though they put Bishop in the film. Could've just had him give Logan some kind of device.",negative
They do not. That’s why I threw that in at the end. I just thought it was funny to tell someone their calling is working a job that doesn’t exist. Really just a long-form way of calling him useless,negative
This is outrageously wrong lol.,negative
"Yeah, but he’s nuts.",negative
This just is a bad metric to determine fame. Halle Berry was everywhere during the 90's and 2000's and I'm not just talking movies but she's a woman and women who age have more difficulty in Hollywood than men.,negative
"Speaking of Monster Ball, that was a weird one to watch with my parents.",negative
"Wouldn’t say that he got a decent role, he was used to make Doom look stronger and was ridiculously out of character, could’ve used any other character because he just had a generic bad guy personality for some reason.",negative
"the fuck you on about? you said she was more successful, whats that got to do with how famous she is? cant you just admit you got it wrong? Is it that hard?",negative
"> Halle did have more success than Jackman outside of the X men movie

>This just is a bad metric to determine fame.
    
Righty ho.",negative
She hasn’t aged though— she still looks un-friggin- believable,negative
Talking about the Hickman run.,neutral
Lmao.  Some of us have to work 12 hour shifts…I kind of envy being tired after 12 hours,negative
I think he will be playing Hydra Cap,neutral
"Crossing my fingers for that, even if it’s just a short cameo.",positive
"All of the X-Men are deeply flawed individuals. It's unlikely that any of them could lift Mjolnir.

As for the Fox X-Men specifically, ***maybe*** Kitty or Rogue.",negative
Storm wields Mjölnir in the comics and it’s super cool. I’d love to see a variant of Storm in the Thor Corps in Secret Wars if they do in that direction.,positive
Extremely unlikely. None of them were particularly “worthy” seeming. Obviously Storm wielding Mjolnir in What If…? But the What If…? and X-Men ‘97 versions of Storm are incredibly different than the FoX-Men Storm. As in the animated one has character,negative
Colossus.   He's the only one I think has a shot.  You have to be a genuinely good person and a fierce warrior to be worthy.,positive
"I’m gonna just say no. I do think that Charles is the closest but may genuinely not be “mighty” enough to do it. Magneto is second but he is not pure of heart enough. Who would jump on the grenade, fully expecting to die?",negative
Probably not.  Also don't want Rogue taking Carol's power at least not putting her in a coma,negative
"For me, any version of Wolverine lifting the hammer would ruin the character. Logan’s internal struggle with whether he is a good and noble person, or a savage killer is so important to the character. Like Widow, I don’t think he’d ever even try to lift it.",negative
"Charles manipulates and uses people sometimes, not really a worthy trait.",negative
"Fantastic, excellent. 👍",positive
Can't wait for F4 trailer!,positive
Really excited.,positive
"Hope there will be surprise movie announced, between F4 and Doomsday. No MCU movie for 10+ months are diabolical and dumb, given next one is Avenger with little to none set up. November 2025 or Feb 2026 are available",negative
"It doesn't matter if they are available. For a movie to come out then, it would need to have already been filmed or to be filming right now. And since no movie covers those qualifications, there WON'T be a movie in-between the 2 Avengers movies. 

If you expect one, you will be disappointed.",negative
"I kind of hope they keep Sue’s pregnant until the film releases, it’s fun to theorize!",positive
"Yes, I mean between F4 and Doomsday, that's what OP is asking.",neutral
"Why tf would they announce the X-Men as principle cast members only to kill them off in the first act? 

Let’s use our brains people",negative
I think the theory is X-men vs Avengers.,neutral
"Question. 

Since they were revealed as the cast, that means they are playing a respective role in the movie right? Meaning that like normally cameos and stuff wouldn’t get announced? 

So I’m under the impression if they are apart of the cast, then they are going to have a significant role. Unless I’m just an idiot then I’m sorry",negative
"I wouldn’t like the 4th option, the mutants have already been annihilated in Logan because of Charles killing them and the mutant cure being placed in most major food products, if they just nab the x men from earth 10005 after 2023 (dofp ending) but before 2029 (when Logan takes place) it would be redundant because we know most of the mutants are gonna die offscreen in Logan anyway",negative
Anything but that last option. That will just anger me.,negative
maybe im in the minority but its gonna be stupid if they yet again bring back the fox x-men just to kill them off just to put Doom over. Wish the multiverse BS was just contained to MCU characters,negative
I'm looking forward to seeing the Oakley product placement.,positive
I swear to Christ if anyone says avx,negative
"There are going to be a thousand people in this movie, it'll be tough for anyone to have moments of consequence.",negative
All i ask is that Feige puts some respect back on Cyclops. Fox stunted him in favor of Logan and im still salty about it to this very day.,negative
I’m also assuming this means that Channing Tatum’s Gambit is officially the Fox timeline Gambit,neutral
Gambit gets his spine ripped out,negative
I hope they get killed early. The Fox verse sucks,negative
"What if the men are survivors from dooms universe who followed him to the mcu verse seeking justice or just revenge..

Would be great to see cyclops as the lead of the x men in revenge of Xavier or something like that.  Magneto even being with tho mutants for get back would be sick.",negative
"They’re all dying in an incursion. X-Men v Avengers will be them trying to save their world from the main one, and losing",negative
They’re all dying immediately. Clearing the decks for new versions in Secret Wars.,negative
Glorified cameos and possibly killing off either one or two of them.,negative
theyre 100% going to be cannon fodder for doom with the way the writing has been lately. Just on screen for a bit and then killed. No chance these guys get significant screen time.,negative
"No reason for bringing Tatum back. I didn’t like his Gambit. He didn’t really embody the character. He’s only good as a joke, that’s it.",negative
It’ll be #4. There will be an incursion destroying their world. X-Men’s universe is being destroyed and they send out something to 616 that will ultimately be used by the Avengers to save 616 at the end. Doom somehow piggybacks into 616 to harass this universe. Fantastic Four is also teleported into 616 as well. Hijinks ensue. ,negative
"That's probably it though they might not take everything into account since dark phoenix is obviously not being taken into account (Mystique is alive) 

It makes me wonder if knowing the xmen die in 2028 while logan and charles die in 2029 will give them plot armor in doomsday, Either way hopefully the weirdness of the fox timelines don't make it into the movie",negative
"Ten people too many voted for #4 despite Kelsey Grammer returning.

They didn't toss the Marvels' PCS into the can folks.",negative
"You're not, I agree, I'm really hope it's not just a cameo fest and they acting get to play a prominent part, I've been let down before so expectations are nil",negative
"I agree. They will likely de-age Ian and Patrick, but they are a bit too old/stiff to play these parts in a battle scene and make it look cool.",negative
"Disagree.
You don’t bring in a whole other universe into an Incursion story, let alone set that story up in The Marvels where one of the main characters is trapped in that world, just to kill everyone off after two seconds.

I don’t know if I’d expect McKellen and Stewart to be game for Secret Wars, though.",negative
Actual AvX stories aren’t ever really that good. This is the best reason for them to fight.,negative
"They're important, but they're at the end of their story (at least most of these actors are). It would be dumb to kill them in the first act, but none of them are likely returning after this.",negative
"I don’t doubt that *some* of them will die (I think there will be a lot of deaths in the film), but the idea that they’d bring these legendary actors back just to be jobbers for Doom, is absolutely ridiculous.",negative
Yes absolutely no build up and with an non existent avengers line up,negative
But with this pathetic line up?,negative
"Deadpool & Wolverine made over a billion dollars at the Box Office. So Marvel going to double-down on that. No offense, I honestly don’t see why you think otherwise given the nature of Hollywood.",negative
"Wait until you meet The Maker, probably one of my fav villains of the 21st Century",positive
Yeah good point on Happy I forgot about him in that movie. Everything else you mentioned is useless crap to get people in seats.,negative
You do really believe the X-Men *need* Professor X and Magneto? Deadpool & Wolverine made over a billion dollars without them. Marvel just retire those characters like they have with many other characters.,negative

"He deserves it tbh, the guy was stuck playing minor roles for years until Game of Thrones made him popular.",positive
Beat me to it! 😆,positive
Well technically speaking he was 49 when filming FFFS so he debuted Reed before he turned 50,neutral
Wish he went Clean Shaved for this Reed. That would've been outta park.,negative
">His age is a part of that too.

Bro, Reed is supposed to be a middle-aged man. And Pedro isn't that old anyway, yall are acting like he's going to shrivel up and die by the end of the year",negative

"This is absolutely it, I also wasn’t aware of the disdain towards Pedro but am not surprised. So many grumpy gills out there.",negative
hats off to them for not seeing race ,negative
"It releases after it, but the prevailing theory is that it takes place before or during Doomsday chronologically.",neutral
I get this but also would see Marvel being reluctant to giving Sam another solo movie.,negative
BNW was the worst movie post Endgame.,negative
Why is Iron Fist S1 after The Defenders? Why no spoiler warning for Black widow post credit (also Marvel Studios intro at the beginning) like you did with Ant-Man and the Wasp? Why don't you explain that is not really canon? Why didn't you put the Netflix shows at there canon placement?,negative
"I really wish this could be true for you, with the 4+ movies between Doomsday and Secret war, but I am sad to say that there is probably going to only be Spider-Man: Brand New Day. Possibly one more in the empty slot, but I doubt it",negative
"""maybe this is in order of who's going to get it""

I had similar thoughts.",neutral
"Super Cafe is genuinely one of the things I get most excited about what a new comic book movie comes out. Always a blast. 

Love how they debated doing an actual 5 hour long video as well.",positive
I think they will probably “blame“ it on the Multiverse.,negative
"Hoping for the best. Expecting the worst. I read somewhere they don't even have a script locked down. Might be false info, but it sounds right in light with how Feige and co works.",negative
i don't think that's difficult or the greater public is so attached to fox x-men. and i also feel like we haven't really told traditional x-men stories very well in a long time. also they are old.,negative
"Honestly they should just use the original cast and get REAL writers and create a last gasp of this world. Finish as strong as endgame. Then reboot the whole thing, more grounded for heroes who are unpowered and more crazy for hulks and thors and try the whole thing again. Crazy like invincible level collateral damage.

It would really have to take a different but just as compelling tone to work, which is of course easier said than done.",negative
Doctor Strange 3 definitely makes sense.,positive
"Finally a solo Doop movie.

We're so back, Doopsters.",positive
Imagine if we don't get anything and phase 6 is only 4 movies that would be so meh.,negative
Howard the Duck kills the X-Men Universe,negative
Neither of those are theatrical releases.  They’re specials for Disney+.,neutral

"The question was, ""What do you think the November 2026 release date is?"".",neutral
"Yes. Obviously talking about the November 2026 theatrical release date that Marvel is holding.

Especially since if you read the post it also references the February theatrical release date Marvel is holding.",neutral
"Doomsday has no ground work done. Doom is coming out of nowhere. They have a huge cast of heroes who most don’t know each other because since endgame none of them have interacted when they really should have.

Guardians n Thor should have been a real thing not a pissed away cameo.

No high hopes they don’t focus on getting their scripts solid",negative
"Seeing these characters who've appeared in the previous movies and shows teaming up together is so cool. We know who they are, although to see their dynamics mesh together as a team is something I'm excited to see.",positive
"Not feeling Doomsday yet because there's no story leading into it and I don't care for old cameos for defunct film series. I think I'll be more interested after F4.

Thunderbolts* is a narrative continuation for several projects. It feels like the old rewards for teased projects that we used to get more often.",negative
"I really don’t understand their direction. Obviously everything regarding the multiverse revolved around kang which was of course derailed, but I would have thought they would somewhat hint towards Doom. Thanos was teased as early as 2012 with him actually appearing in like 2018. While I think Doom is cooler than Kang, I would hate them having to do an Origin story in the midst of an Avenger’s movie.",negative
"Yeah it's so rushed. The infinity saga was 11 years, and this ""multiverse"" saga is what 9 years and doesn't even feel like a saga.",negative
"Or maybe I've never seen a Marvel film and just really loved the trailers. 

That's not the case, but it could be. To say I couldn't possibly be excited about a movie without needing to see a bunch of stuff beforehand is ridiculous.

In fact, I wasn't excited because every project you mentioned except for Wakanda Forever was terrible. The trailers are what got me interested.

You do realize people used to just release big team movies like X-Men without needing six solo movies teasing it.",negative
Sounds bs to me,negative

"No it’s not? Thor 4 was Multiverse Saga. Strange 2. Guardians 3. Panther 2. Ant-Man 3. Cap 4. Hell, even the last film in *this* series, Spider-Man 3, was during this saga.

Captain Marvel 2? Marvels?,neutral
"Wow really? You have to go out of your way to redefine every sequel as a ""follow-up""? Get a fucking grip",negative
"I think that speaks to such a total and utter failure of planning. What do you mean you are trying to do another endgame with a bunch of heros who have been in one movie with no sequels??? They shot way to broad and really should have tightened their focus.

Likely either Doctor Strange or Shang Chi,neutral
Are they still releasing something on that date?,neutral
Ant-Man: Quantamania 2,neutral
I hope they don’t follow that,negative
"Can we stop parroting this when we have the answers? Simu's torn achilles, two writer's strikes, a pandemic.",negative
"Unfortunately its probably because Shang-Chi didn't actually do all that well. Out of all the movies in the multiverse saga, the only ones that did worse were Eternals, Black Widow, and The Marvels. Shang-Chi only BARELY made more money than Eternals.",negative
No it’s just technicalities. The TV Shows definitely should count more and acting like half the movies weren’t sequels already is silly.,negative
Ant-Man 2 was in the Infinity Saga,neutral
"Yeah i do agree its a bit misleading, maybe something like Spider-Man will be the first franchise with more than 1 film in the Multiverse Saga or something like that",negative

"It's not ""different"" = ""bad""????

Frankly I shouldn't have to spell it out but it's not that, it's the fact that they didn't build up any worth while momentum with these characters? The studio practically admitted it themselves, they spread themselves to thin and are not tightening their focus.",negative
So WandaVision and Agatha All Along do count?,neutral

DOOM likes to let people know he is behind everything and despite knowing that you couldn’t even stop him. It’s the ultimate testament to his ego.",negative
"This is peak, great theory bro this sounds really similar to what I predict will happen. You cooked with this.",positive
"This is really good, especially with more Avengers movies",positive
"I think they omitted too many characters to not have another cast announcement. Spider-Man, Strange, the Hulks, Guardians, Deadpool, Wolverine, etc. wild if an Avengers movie omitted all those characters.",negative
Fantastic Four will be the main setup. There may be a scene or two at the end of Thunderbolts linking some characters.,neutral
I think Doom might be teased in the F4 stinger.,negative
Agreed this would be great,positive
Do you mean like the 2 minute video Marvel released after the livestream was done?,neutral
"I feel like I need to clarify why I made this video - I made it because it still includes the theme song for the actors revealed, and also simply because I was bored. Have a great day!",positive
"They should rename the movie:  Avengers:  Boomsday.  

There are so many old ass boomers in this movie.  Some of the X-Men actors are in their 80's.  This is getting pathetic.",negative
That is a fire cast...Goddamn.,positive
Because she is not a good black panther. her having physical abilities ruins the character's strengths and makes her into blah supergenius who ate a plant,negative
Ludwig Göransson is a great choice for just about any film. He’s a special talent.,positive
Thomas Newman would do a great job i think. I love his ethereal style,positive
Yes it will be great,positive
I don’t understand why everything always has to be in crisis. It’s not that hard to be a bit hopeful especially when Spider-Man movies hardly miss.,negative
Thank god you’re here- I’ll let Disney know right away,positive
"Yes thanks!
CABWN was a mess to say the least.",negative
Rocket: how much for the visor,neutral
This just gave me unrealistic expectations.,negative
This but it’s gonna be in the X-Jet calling it now,neutral
"It took 25 years, but it's going to be cool to see Marsden finally get to kick proper ass as Cyclops.",positive
He really is the people’s princess 👑,positive
He loves his job. 😂,positive
NGL...This made me laugh,positive
This is actually funny lol,positive
"I hate that purple guy, always with the snapping… erm.. he’s right behind me isn’t he?",negative
I like how the intensity increases in each shot.,positive
This is incredible,positive
Hop was a good ass movie.,positive
Was Rocket announced in the cast?,neutral
He looks more annoyed in each one like as if going “ how did I get wrapped up in this shit AGAIN?!”,negative
I can't believe this isn't /r/shittymoviedetails,negative
He's gonna wear that yellow blue suit! Can't wait,positive
"Genuinely hope they make this, the pure meme potential is unfathomable",positive
Wait hop was actually a good Easter movie,positive
Don’t tease me like this,negative
"OP literally ripped off someone else's post using the same first two pictures.

You're like streamers who steal other people's TikTok videos to show on their channel.",negative
This was the internet I needed today. Thank you,positive
Why in all three photos is he wearing his seatbelt so low. The seatbelt is hardly across his shoulder. In the event of an accident the seatbelt may not be as effective if it is not worn properly.,negative
This so needs to happen Russo brothers! - Marsden is a very underrated actor,positive
No fucking way cyclops is in HOP it make no sense 😲,negative
Avengers should have ended after End Game. Half of them are ready for retirement. They're just cash grabbing at this point.,negative
Also that time he was a complete badass on Westworld,positive
This is hilarious XD,positive
"Brad Pitt wasn't in the casting announcement, but I really hope his new Guardians team are somehow integrated into this already a behemoth of a movie!",positive
The ride goes on!,positive
God I fucking hope so that would be so funny,positive
This would be so funny.,positive
"This is the humor post of the year, no doubt!",positive
Is it just me or does the CGI get worse from top to bottom?,negative
"I saw this and was like ""Wow, James Marsden really does look like Cyclops here, this is a great casting choice.""


Only to realise he was the original Cyclops from when I was a kid, wow.",positive
That is why James is a multi talented actor.,positive
this is basically why nobody notices Clark Kent as Superman,negative
He’s also in a “relatively” new My Little Pony movie. My daughter loves it. He’s actually a really good singer.,positive
He was fantastic in the show *Paradise* on Hulu that just came out a month or two ago.,positive
"It's ok, everyone forgot he was Cyclops anyway. What small screentime and getting pathetically killed off  does to a mf",negative
Yea I couldn’t process this either for some reason.,negative
True. James has a great singing voice.,positive
"He's such a Prince Charming! I love that 30 Rock teased him, like calling him an elf prince",positive
It's good to see that James got a chair in Avengers Doomsday,positive
They won't. Marvel is out of touch and doesn't do fan service like that.,negative
Reed making it would be a bit ironic,negative
"Well she got Idina Menzel in the Enchanted, and they look cute in the sequel.",positive
"They need to do a joke of him commenting ""Why does this keep happening to me?""",negative
"Ngl it's my guilty pleasure. Like, it's not at all a masterpiece by any means and it does steal a bit of elements from The Santa Clause (not to mention also the main lead being voiced by Russel Brand 😬), but James is the reason I rewatch it at least once every year.",positive
And why Fox was a bunch of clowns for wasting such a good actor.,negative
He has barely aged.,negative
Teddy coming back in the last season was so peak for me. Damn he rocked that role. What a great actor.,positive
His best role by far.,positive
He's a gorgeous man with a great singing voice and who seems based on the interview clips I've seen of him (and his part on the Jury Duty tv show) to have a very likable personality. It pisses me off,negative
There's a sequel?,neutral
"Scott would never willingly hurt a tiny animal lmfaoo, he'd probably hold his eyes shut while handing Rocket the visor and asking Beast for a new one",negative
"He still looks the same and I'm losing hairs. 

X-Men came out when I was in middle school",negative
And such a good character. Instead of X-Men they just Made the Wolverine and Friends series of movies.,positive
"He's incredible in Westworld, but again his character is completely wasted by the end.",negative
He was meant to play that role. Fits him perfectly,positive
He’s also in Hairspray. Corney Collins,neutral
"Both interpreted Sherlock Holmes, RDJ at the last decade Duology and Benedict on BBC's series.",neutral
"There is, the whole plot of the movie is wandavision tho. Redhead feels empty, uses magic to enslave the whole town into her fantasy, slowly becoming the villain in red, and fought another magic lady with purple powers",negative
He was amazing in the new show Paradise that just finished season one recently.,positive
"That's hate lol. Took me a long minute to realize I seen him a million times, Westworld is another good one..teddy... And then it took me watching each movie to realize he great in every movie. idk what slowed the spotlight so much.  ",negative
And he fits it perfectly,positive
A fake 'leak' from Kang Dynasty.,negative
What do you mean by interpreted?,neutral
"Eh, considering how long it had been, it was about as good as could be expected. I enjoyed it, and watching Amy Adam's get to ham it up as >!a villain!< with a banger song was fun",positive
"It blows my mind that there are already adults, *post-college age*, that weren’t cognizant during 9/11. 

You’re about to be 25, and you’ll be 35 in the blink of an eye. Don’t fuck about with your time, it goes faster than you realize.",negative
"Not exactly dropped, as the actor left when the director did to do the director's next movie. But poorly utilized up to that point, I agree.",negative
Martin Freeman AND Jude Law. Both Watsons are in the MCU too,neutral
"Well I think is gonna be super great if that happend, James Marsden have been the greatest side actor with these og characters :) I think this is gonna be amazing those years by now no 2025-2028, Ulimate movies",positive
"X2 was a good movie I don't care what anyone says, that nightcrawler opening scene, the intro to Colussus, Pyro going bad, and Logan Roy as the villian... still holds up",positive
I think they legit were some good to great in with mediocre and awful movies,negative
"No argument there, Wolverine would butt heads with the wall if it was in charge.",negative
Agreed. Against all odds Dofp was spectacular. First class was a step in the right direction but then Singer's stench came back.,positive
"?

Not calling them Avengers films could result in loss of revenue. Even if small, that is the very last thing that the MCU needs",negative
Avengers sells tickets.,neutral
Same reason it was “Captain America: Civil War” and not just “Civil War”. The “Avengers” brand is too marketable and too recognizable.,negative
"Release order is the way to go. Wandavision, Loki season 1 and 2 should get you ready. ",positive
Always release order. I would also highly recommend that you watch Daredevil and Daredevil Born Again because they’re both great.,positive
"The post credit scene is a spoiler, and playing around with what post credit scenes should be watched at what point if ever would add a whole other layer of unnecessary complexity.",negative
Yeah but they want a good streamlined watch order. Watching Black Widow after Civil War would mean they deal with the post credit scene before the death actually happens. Very unnecessary.,negative
The beginning of X2 with Nightcrawler in the White House is still one of my favorite scenes from any Marvel movie. Seeing it in the theater when I was 15 with my best friend was incredible.,positive
"""I am invincible!"" 💪🏻🥶",positive
Xavier's isnt the only mansion full of wacky antics he's been living in,negative
I adore Alan Cumming,positive
"This was the announcement that made me sit forward and go “WAIT! Wtf?!?” I was not expecting him or Marsden, I’m so excited!",positive
"Ooh, ooh! I love him! They never did enough with Nightcrawler.",positive
Building up Nightcrawler as the best character in X2 and then sitting on him for 8 movies straight was a waste.,negative
"If they can do Nebula and Gamora with makeup, then they should do as many mutants as they can with makeup too. If half the mutants are CGI then I will be very disappointed.",negative
"“I think the X-Men film I’m in is the gayest film that I’ve ever done, and that’s me saying that,” Cumming told Entertainment Weekly


I love this guy lmao",positive
What if he’s playing a Loki Variant?,neutral
"I betcha he's gonna be full cgi, the guy hated being in the Nightcrawler makeup.",negative
He’s so good in “Reefer Madness: The Musical” if you get a chance,positive
"X2: to this day, one of the best superhero movie intros",positive
Awesome to see him again,positive
"He’s making a great resurgence with The Traitors and this will put him back in the mainstream spotlights, meaning he’ll have big project job security for the next 3-5 years at least.",positive
"I thought he was done being Nightcrawler

Didn't he say the makeup process was a pain in the ass?",negative
"What if it's not Nightcrawler, but Loki from that god awful movie",negative
"I just don’t get these comebacks, unless a multiverse? Wasn’t the whole point off getting the X license to reboot the franchise and do their own long Avengers run with the property? Why bring back all these 20 year old cast?",negative
"It's about time, he was excellent in that role.",positive
I’m hyped!!!! I just wish we would get Kurt/Logan/Colossus team up.,positive
Agreed!  That scene was fantastic and a really good (and still unmatched/unsurpassed) example of how teleportation powers can be portrayed.,positive
"The Blade nightclub scene and the the Nightcrawler White House scene, winners and still champions!",positive
"Unfortunately I wasn’t born when the film came out, but I agree that scene is one of the best, hopefully they rerelease it in theatres one day, I’d love to see it on the big screen

(Before anyone asks about my age, I’m 19)",positive
Queue dozens complaining about cgi saying he should’ve done makeup,negative
"Fuck, I just realized they are likely going to CGI his whole damn body 🙄",negative
Logan and Kurt are one of the best friendships in Marvel history. I hope they give us that in the next X-Men movies…,positive
Holy shitI just put it together that he is boris. I feel dumb,negative
"I fancasted Walter Goggins but this is a good choice

Edit: Walton",positive
"Fuck, my autism is flaring up just looking at how GOOD he looks, like it still feels like Ebon is the Thing because of the eyes. Marvel is healing, I can feel it",positive
"Jean Grey, by order of the Traitors you have been murdered.",negative
I’ve thought for a long time that Alan Cumming playing brothers or at least a character with Tom Hiddleston would make for some great scenes.,positive
"He and Rebecca Romijn will switch roles for Doomsday.  

Why does that sound pretty amazing, actually?",positive
Evan was such a let down,negative
"That’s pretty much the X-Men movies in a nutshell, all fluff and no substance.",negative
"Finally, something we can all rally behind",positive
He is in the Mcu already ,neutral
Mephisto has the worst health code violations in his restaurant! Some of them would shock you!,negative
"Yess yes. Mystique needs to wear clothes after 2 decades of not wearing any, I'm so happy and excited that he's marvellous and iconic mutants are finally getting the looks that fans like me and others all over the world have been waiting and dying to see as well.

"Never brought up before?

The man has been extremely vocal for years. He's up there with Mr Takai for being at the forefront. He's a legend.",positive
He’s always been a blast of camp energy whenever he’s on the Graham Norton show 😂,positive
I hope so. I’m really interested in that new XMen movie wave. Hoping we get a similar long form treatment like Avengers got.,positive
Mutant and proud.,positive
"The fixation of fox movies wanted mystique to be naked all the time is kind of weird, even if she has clothes in her human disguise, she is still practically naked.",negative
"Also wouldn’t it be cheaper/easier to have had her wear some clothes? Less makeup.

Although I definitely recall Jennifer Lawrence catching strays for complaining about the makeup process towards the end of her time as Mystique.",negative
Plus points if they make Mystique Nightcrawler’s dad!,positive
I mean that seems to be the case I just feel like I haven’t seen much of him in general in the last decade. If they are not in the light you don’t hear things like this. Same with Cummings until I watched the traitors I didn’t know he was gay either. I in general can’t tell someone sexuality from watching them act.,negative
Y’all downvoting as copium but not give a source is hilarious. What they say on MSS is really true.,negative
Singer fucks kids,negative
I understood that reference!,positive
"Millennial here, just always happy to see Alan Cumming in something that isn't a sequel to The Mask.",positive
Oh I hope so,positive
The scene where they are flying and the airplane is failing and he has to teleport out and grab people was also really good.,negative
Probably what ruined Brad Renfro's life.,negative
"That's not why though, we can't be sure this was known widely back in the early 2000s. 

The reason is that he was a terrible boss, and was verbally abusive to people on set.",negative
Hope you’re watching him host The Traitors cause he is a fantastic host there.,positive
"Yeah, I didn't like that at all.",negative
"That’s the scary thing; even with people calling these perverts out in public forums, it took such a long time to hold anyone accountable. I don’t know how Hannibal Burress broke through.",negative
"I did hear that much. Yikes. 

I guess it really is that culture changed that much (for the better)",negative
"They're stuck in a cycle where they forget marvel has had a spectrum in quality with their movies since day 1, and that their taste speaks for everyone. 

Mix that with the fact they don't approach things with nuance, if 20% of the film had something they disliked then the entire franchise is in shambles and if it had 5% they did like then the movie was infallible.",negative
"There were like, two disappointing projects post endgame with legitimate, non-toxic reasons. A vast majority has been awesome, people just love complaining",negative
Some people literally said they were done after Endgame. I take every salty take as evidence that they're mad they haven't been following every show and movie since and now might have to get back on board.,negative
It never left for me but honestly that stuff annoyed me especially those who were saying for every new thing since Endgame so I was confused since it was covering everything.,negative
">That movie was the greatest letdown of anything in the whole run of the MCU for me.

You must not have watched Secret Invasion then.",negative
Well they never stopped making content but they have definitely had some misses.,negative
I love the whole thing,positive
"Not really, no. The stakes complaints and being sick of the multiverse are both valid. “It’s just journalists” is the sort of cope Snyderverse weirdos used to peddle.",negative
Deadpool & Wolverine was well received cuz it was a good movie and yes it was a crowd pleaser but it was done well which is why it was a success,positive
"MCU is definitely riding the nostalgia bait. Spider-Man NWH and DP&W are clear examples of this. I watched both with my ex who didn't really watch the original references and she thought they were meh. I also thought they were meh beyond the nostalgia. The whole premise of NWH is based on dumb, reckless decisions. DP&W was trying so hard to ""save the MCU"", but it just seemed like an excuse for a nostalgiafest.",negative
"You’re right, I didn’t. Lol. I had very low expectations for SI, with it being a fairly early show there was no way they could afford to include enough characters to really do that story justice. I was much more excited for Quantumania to further the Kang story after Loki, and it fell very flat for me.",negative
"Or Hulk and Thor 2 💩 
Just as bad.",negative
Cap 4 was pretty damn good too so i’d say it’s a safe bet,positive
"Iron Man 2 & 3, Thor,  Dark World and Age of Ultron were all received worse than most MCU projects that came out in the last few years. The first Avengers movie made the MCU much more mainstream, but there were tons of films that felt like shitters before the grander story connected and retroactively added value to some of the films.",negative
"I loved those movies when they came out. I saw them both in theaters opening day. Don’t tell me what I thought about them. Nothing was as bad as The Eternals, The Marvels, Quantumania, Brave New World, and the D+ shows.

Edit: Except The Incredible Hulk. That movie sucked. That was a phase 1 miss for sure.",negative
"[The ratings don't](https://i.imgur.com/dxZgntF.jpg). 

The quality of Iron Man and the promise of The Avengers basically carried those movies to box office success, but the reception & general feedback was that they were disappointments compared to Iron Man.",negative
"Never said it was. Although I remember a bunch of people leaving the theater on opening night of AoU complaining that the movie sucked. Regardless, your comment was that the early phases didn’t have misses, when they absolutely did.",negative
">but the reception & general feedback was that they were disappointments compared to Iron Man.

The general feedback was large box office takes.  

No one knew who the Avengers were, comics were a vanishingly small niche product by that point and the general audience had no idea that ""Avengers"" were even a thing.",negative
"Ahh I see you are back to making excuses for the earlier phases huh? I could do the same thing for the Marvels release during a Strike or for Eternals/Black Widow release during a Plague that keeps everybody in that movie theaters are still suffering from to this day.

But I'm sure that doesn't matter to it is it? You probably thinks that COVID was a sham that was made up by the government or some other Conspriacy theory nonsense.

Also According to you, Captain Marvel is the 9th best Marvel Movie ever huh.",negative
"Missed opportunity - instead of bringing out the chair for Ant-Man, they should have just showed a clip from Mac & Me.",negative
"Serious: That's why there needed to be MORE gag chairs.

Tiny Rudd chair.

Ebon Moss-Bachrach chair made of rocks.

Tenoch Huerta being covered in seaweed and barnacles and slightly moist.

Etc.",negative
"Rhodey, careful on re-entry, there’s an idiots chair in the landing zone",negative
The Antman movies are far from my (or most peoples') favorites but I absolutely love their gimmicky marketing and how hard they're commited to it. Like those poster. It's just great.,positive
I saw a reveal with a regular sized chair for Paul Rudd. Anyone got a link to the one with the tiny chair?,neutral
Paul Rudd is awesome,positive
Rudd is insanely likeable guy,positive
Ant man is a really terrible part of the mcu. Its a very tired schtick,negative

"Should have been. This was ""malfunctioning suit"" sized",negative
"Only now there’s no Hulk announced yet, so there’s no benevolent monster to give him tacos ☹️",negative
"> just guarantees the movie will just be all action and cgi, and no depth or character 

Which was famously on display with Endgame. No depth or character. 

Obviously it won’t be Endgame, but to say cameos equal no depth or character is a tad doomish (no pun intended)",negative
"and if there's one thing we've seen from the MCU, especially Russo MCU, it's a lack of character in ensemble movies.  Get outta here, man.",negative
"They managed to make Infinity War and Endgame with a huge cast. Not sure why they couldn't do it with this one. Obviously some characters won't be centerpiece, that's OK too. No one expects a full character arc from M'Baku, Cyclops, Ghost, Namor and the new Falcon in that movie...",negative
Just bring back his friend to recap everything so far. Best part of Antman,positive
"There’s a new marvel out, it’s supposed to be NUTS",negative
Rudd is the BEST ,positive
"I read the title and though ""Weird, Paul Rudd never struck me as the type to feel emasculated over a joke, he seems to laugh at himself all the time"".

The full quote makes much more sense. I don't know how I feel about OP leaving it out of the title. Clickbait?",negative
That's embarrassing for the DOD,negative
I'm so grateful they did. Genuinely my favourite Star Wars moment since ROTJ,positive
But the Americans didn't and it got spoiled for me before I'd got home from work to watch it,negative
Where's your hall pass?,neutral
"I love Hulk so much in that scene. Nebula being needlessly a jerk, Hulk being a sweetheart.",positive
Across the Spiderverse was full of cameos and look at the depth it had.,positive
Avengers PC Small Group,neutral
I can’t wait for that movie it’s gonna be glorious,positive
"It’s embarrassing for America. And the reason they did it is to get around FOIA, which makes it even worse.",negative
Private browsing my man! 😇,positive
"And it should be plainly stated that what they did was illegal.  Not just irresponsible, not just dumb, not just dangerous to American airmen and intelligence agents involved in the strikes, but it was flat out illegal, violating a number of laws in regards to handling of non-classified and classified government data, as well as a number of laws regarding information retention and FOIA requests.

They knew what they were doing, it wasn't a one time mistake, it was the 1 time they got caught.  All of them should be fired and in prison, which is exactly what would happen if any of their subordinates did the exact same things they did.",negative
Yeah. That might have been resentment from that incident.,negative
">not just dangerous to American airmen and intelligence agents involved in the strike

*Yes, I'm sure those people piloting drones from behind a screen are at such a massive risk from the Yemeni children they're bombing.*",negative
Why thank you kind stranger.  I hope your weekend is fantastic,positive
"I think I saw them say it's gonna be a blend of the original and Hickmans, which is interesting. If done right, it could be epic. I just want to see Thor go out like a boss like he did in Time Runs Out.",positive
The problem with this idea is that they haven’t set up any incursions problem.,negative
"I hope not.

I don't want to see the Illuminati heroes deciding to destroy another universe to protect our own. (edit: Or even seriously consider it.)

No one saw the end of *Avengers: Infinity War* coming. Every comic book reader would instantly recognize ""Time Runs Out.""",negative
"Incursions was mentioned in Multiverse of Madness but yeah it’s a shame, phase 4-6 if planned correctly could have set up multiple incursions like the infinity stones with a ticking clock knowing it will all come down to one final incursion",negative
">I don't want to see the Illuminati heroes deciding to destroy another universe to protect our own.

* They didn't do that. They thought about doing so but ultimately they cancelled the plan",negative
Bingo,positive
"Why? Even in the comics, that’s pretty flimsy, but in the MCU, there’s almost nothing to suggest this.",negative
It would be kind of an hilarious troll if all the returning X-men actors are just playing new characters with no relation to the X-men.,negative
that would be insane,negative
"Multiverse ""Son of the Mask""... oh god... please not",negative
I would be shocked if this film includes anything except single variants from a single parallel universe.,negative

Honestly? Hands down my favorite Loki. Forever ever.,positive
"Celebrities seem to love working with him. I don’t get it either but it makes sense if you are just a fantastic coworker that people would be giving you appearances in everything. Kind of like normal jobs, those soft skills go a long way!",positive
For real? Loki S1 or S2?,neutral
That would be stupid ,negative
Holy FUCK I can’t believe I’ve gone 20 years without realizing that Floop and Nightcrawler are the same actor. Hysterical.,negative
This is brilliant,positive
No shot. Completely different tones.,negative
This is bloody genius,positive
"I thought the exact same thing! 

The Young Avengers still need someone with experience to lead them, and my guess is Matt.

No I didn’t watch possibly the biggest movie in the entirety of the MCU.,negative
His was honestly one of the better Disney+ shows.,positive
So far the only show I revisited.  It’s pretty fun in rewatch.,positive
"She-Hulk was one of my favorites as well, it didn’t deserve all the hate it got.
Then later she got raged baited all to kingdom come with articles like.
“The Actress is furious that she was cut from Deadpool and Wolverine” which if you saw the movie totally didn’t make sense.",negative
"Because it utilizes nostalgia factor. Also, you’re taking this waaayy too seriously, do you take all jokes this serious?",negative
"It was funny, structured like an actual sitcom. Didn’t take itself too seriously. Pissed off all the incels.",negative
"The Twerk scene I really liked, such an oscar worthy performance, it is if not one of the best peak marvel moments of all time",positive

Woah getting “Thank You” is a pretty big deal! Hope “No Problem” isn’t too torn up about not getting in.,positive
I THANK YOU 3000,positive
Getting 275 million views for a cast chair announcement is bonkers!!,negative
But where’s Stan Lee? :( rip,negative
I bet they won’t thank me in the actual film,negative
Awesome.,positive
"Such a talented actor. Really excited, can't hardly wait for the premiere!!",positive
Marvel hiring a no name for an avengers movie is a good sign for the future!,positive
Omg I grew up with his movies. No doubt he's just cannon fodder but still awesome to see him back.,positive
He was a wreck until he changed his last name to You. He turned his life around after that.,negative
His collaboration with Dido also makes him one of the greatest songwriters of all time.,positive
I would love that!! Really enjoyed his performance as Glup Shitto in the Star Wars films.,positive

No Wesley Snipes? Motherfuckers must be skating up hill.,negative

I hope him being doom is just a feint and we get someone else in the role",negative

The bar wasn’t a billion for The Marvels. It was profitability. That movie lost 250+ million dollars. That is INSANE.,negative

"Tbh they have gotten better with budget 

Brave new world cost 180 and that’s with its reshoots, what would its original budget be? Around 110-130…not exactly awful considering the movie would have made even more if not for that ridiculous controversy about Mackie “nOt rEsPEctIng aMErICA”……They are on a better track clearly.",negative
Deadpool and wolverine made them more than a billion dollar THAT'S INSANE,negative
It's ok to be obsessed with sports. But it's weird if you make hating sports your hobby.,negative
">The breakeven million is about 800 million dollars when you factor in reshoots and marketing budget, try again.

Yes, we know Disney is a liar and a bitch. This thing can cost one trillion dollars and is co-funded by Saudis but what matters more is your obsession with film that you don't finance, and don't have a significant financial stake in.

You still have time to consult a doctor.",negative

A bomb is losing money. A movie needing to make 800 million dollars and making 400 is a bomb. The best term used to describe a movie as that is as The Guardian used “flopbuster”.,negative
I didn’t realize saying Marvel movies losing money means I hate women. I guess I’ll find out tomorrow that saying Walmart had a less than stellar quarter means that I’m a racist?,negative
Correct. My original comment said The Marvels and Brave New World were box office failures considering they lost money. And your comment reaffirms my point with Marvel since Endgame every other movie is a success or a failure.,negative
You were replying to my initial comment. If you want to include me responding to people that’s not very fair my sweet prince.,negative
"Sports mixes in being unhappy when your team loses, the box office is no different.

Okay I just realized you're a troll. Because there's no way anyone actually believes something like this",negative

So sad and desperate 😔 you could do with a hug 🤗,negative
"And non of those numbers have even been confirmed. 

Someone made the claim and never backed it up end everyone keeps running with it with no proof.

"Thank you lol, it’s nice to see someone who can think now and then",positive
"Anything that loses the company money who made the movie. The Guardian had a good term for big movies that still lose money, it was called “the flopbuster”.

"If people respond to me, I won’t leave them hanging, that’s not fair.",negative
"It’s easier to allocate 50 million dollars to a movie instead of 100 million for a movie like Mickey 17, vs 2 teams of highly skilled athletes going against each other. Movies have competition, but not to the point of crushing each other. Movies fail due to internal incompetence, not external factors of other teams. Universal didn’t make Snow White fail, Disney did that (for example).",negative
"It is easier, but when you hire people that don’t care about movies and couldn’t gauge how much an IP could make at the global box office, you’ll have problems",negative

You're still trying to compare sports to movies. That doesn't work that way,negative

when is snow white joining the avengers? or will she be an x-man?,neutral
"If we factor in streaming Disney+ series the financial losses skyrocket, so I’m avoiding that because that gets way more messy. Disney+ has lost billions and Disney simply clumps in all streaming services together now. She Hulk and Ms Marvel are not selling anything. Also don’t on the new Avengers movies pulling Marvel out of the hole they’re in, sure they’ll probably be profitable, but not enough to start subsiding other movies massive losses.",negative
"Victoria Alonso worked on all of them besides Brave New World, and she was definitely a problem, but she got fired for torpedoing them. The problem is the people that shouldn’t be running these movies.",negative
It’s a comparison to show Disney’s current incompetence. Disney is making their way back to normal movies but it will take a while to flush out all the garbage they have in their company.,negative
I really don’t understand how they went so wrong with Taskmaster. They literally pulled a Deadpool from Wolverine Origins,negative
Idk. I still think Marvel is tricking us lol. I think more ppl will die. Red Guardian and Ghost possibly.,negative
They did the character and the actress dirty. Why include her in the first place? Seems like she's only there as cannon fodder; just a character to kill off so they can up the stakes. Not amused and not impressed but i'll hold off on judging the rest of the movie until it's released.,negative
Who cares? Taskmaster was written terribly. Let her be killed off so we can get on with the real taskmaster.,negative
"Bit of a shame really, they were a total nothing in Black Widow but Taskmaster is a pretty cool character in other media",negative
Her placing on the original version of the scene was so weird too,negative
"Good! Get rid of that garbage taskmaster and get Tony masters in during a future production. Even if it is a long time away. I don’t even mind that they gender changed the character either, that was never my issue with it tbh, but at least give the character some personality rather than just being a dull mind controlled bore with no personality at all! Both the spider man game and various animated series had better taskmasters. They ruined this one just by how they portrayed her.",negative
Who cares if she dies or not what are we really missing out on here,negative
"I'm just glad to see my boy Alexei is gonna be alive and well, he's legit my favorite character in the MCU alongside Kamala Khan",positive

It would have been good if Bucky and Yelena was the only survivor with John Walker getting a fake death",negative
Somebody's getting fired.,negative
She’s ghosting them….,negative
Someone at Disney hates Taskmaster it's odd,negative
"Maybe she ends up retiring like Clint and Maeve? Or the actress isn’t needed for Doomsday because it will be a masked stunt double the entire time?

But yea, if it does happen, they’re doing a bad job at promoting/hiding like a certain video game called >!The Last of Us 2!< .. which I have not even played yet, but it was obvious from the beginning",negative
The days of marvel studios carefully thinking these things out and planning ahead are loooooong gone. Could be as stupid as no one checked to see if she was available.,negative
good this task master sucked so much,negative
I still think she's gonna deflect and betray them for Val cause she's actually offering her something in return for her services.,negative
What if she dies very early n in comedic way ala slipknot from suicide squad,negative
"It would be so hilarious that everyone thinks Taskmaster is gonna die, only to find out that she just decided that all this (the entire plot of Thunderbolts) ain't worth doing and leaves.",negative
The fact that they're being so unsubtle with it makes me think they're trying to mislead us.,negative
still the biggest shame how terrible they made Taskmaster in the mcu. just the worst adaption they've probably have done,negative
"It would be such a crazy move for them to have made this announcement and then someone like Red Guardian ends up actually dying in the film. 

It could be the ultimate bluff in making everyone believe all the Thunderbolts are surviving.",negative
Thank god. Hopefully we can get a good taskmaster now in the future.,positive
Guys. Marvel loves to lie in their promos. Trying to figure it out is really a fool's errand.,negative
They're not even trying to hide it lol. Act 1 early Sentry victim.,negative
I hope so. Very dead.,negative
Damn I was hoping red guardian would be killed off,negative
its terrifying to know that marvel can just wipe anyone out of existence,negative
Good. MCU Taskmaster sucks. Comics Taskmaster is where it's at and they screwed it up.,negative
Kurylenko? More like Kurilienka. Thank god they ditched her,negative
The trailers have been telegraphing Taskmaster's death pretty hard from the beginning; It would be more of a twist if she *doesn't* get the Omni-Man treatment from Sentry early on in the movie.,negative
Marvel is always intentionally misleading with all of their marketing 🤷🏻‍♂️ we don’t know what’s real and what isn’t.,negative
"Does anyone not think we might be getting a ""The Suicide Squad"" type of situation. With the reception these last couple of phases being underwhelming and rumors of rebooting the MCU, I could absolutely see half this cast getting killed in the first 15 minutes to establish what a credible threat RDJ Doom is.",negative
Sentry is gonna kill her,negative
marvel sucks ass . they need to do some wild shit. cause they are a mess,negative
So I guess she isn't even worthy enough to use her death as a shock factor,negative
Never believe Marvel marketing.,negative

"Could be that.  Could be a different point in time in the same scene, after Tasky exits stage right.",neutral

Good taskmaster was awful,negative
"Also: LMAO at MCU Taskmaster’s one fan downvoting everyone.

Touch grass!",negative

"Anyone has the link to the widescreen spot? I keep seeing the ""insta"" aspect ratio and it's super annoying",negative
"If they do kill her off doesn't it bother anyone else that technically they've decided the least culpable character is the one that has to die.

USAgent killed a guy in cold blood onscreen.
Ghost did missions for SHIELD that probably involved murder/assassination.
Red Guardian probably did shady stuff for Russia.
Yelena probably has killed people.

Meanwhile taskmaster literally was a mind controlled puppet for most of her life. She is as innocent as Bucky but because she has no dialogue so far then she doesn't elicit the same sympathy.

I won't be too sad if she does die but it feels like a waste especially as they could have made her a supporting character for Bucky - they literally have the exact same trauma to deal with.",negative
I mean... Duh? We always knew Taskmaster was not making it out alive. They telegraphed her death harder than they did Mrs. Hart's death.,negative
"I agree. Everyone wants her to be more like comics Taskmaster, and that guy would get the hell out of there if he had to fight a serious villain.",negative
"It’s honestly a good thing most of the team seemingly survives, Marvel is remembering they have to use their characters more than once every 4 years to keep them relevant in the eyes of non-hardcore fans. 

We don’t want an Avengers movie where the general audience doesn’t recognize half the cast.

Though I think the T-Bolts will end up mostly being death fodder for Doom. Even Sentry might get taken out somehow to prove how strong Doom is.",negative
I mean honestly just saying you’re casting some of the people who will die in an upcoming movie before then is a great way to confuse people. But kinda rude to the actors so idk if they would,negative
People have been killing off Red Guardian since his first appearance.,negative
"> Red Guardian and Ghost possibly.

No fucking way.    David Harbour and Hannah JK are incredible actors, it would be so stupid just to waste them as kill-offs.",negative
They also stole the movie’s thunder with that What If episode about Buck and Red Guardian. It really should have come out after Thunderbolts.,negative
"Let's be honest here. If Marvel doesn't care enough to develop the live action version of Taskmaster, then they have no interest in adapting the character as more than just fodder ala Crossbones.",negative
"EXACTLY, still can’t believe they butchered a badass villain.",negative
Hopefully this is what happens. Atrocious use of a character,negative
Yup they ruined the character with that awful backstory,negative
"I do like the idea of a female Tasky, just for variety's sake, but sweet fuck was her backstory bad. And just let her talk, Marvel, please. The brooding silence isn't doing it for anyone.",negative
Really offended over a nothing of a character aren’t we?,negative

They did kill Black Widow when everyone assumed she was safe due to having a solo movie slated to come out the following year.,negative
What characters are confirmed to appear in multiple variants?,neutral
I'm not even complaining about this movie. Just the fact that they literally changed everything about their personality in Black Widow. He's characterized as being aloof and having a sharp tongue and an innate ability to mimic their target. Instead they turned her into a mute that relies on tech. I'm just pointing out how that's exactly what they did to Deadpool in the Wolverine movie.,negative
"""Woke""

My god you people are miserable.",negative
"Be Honest, if the ""real"" Taskmaster was in Black Widow, you guys would have bitched about him losing to a Woman and still called it ""Woke"" Or some other nonsense",negative
Oh get the fuck out red hat,negative
Because they made Taskmaster a woman? Do you also hate Nick Fury because they cast a black actor even though he was white in the comics? Does that mean the MCU's always been woke? Fuck outta here man,negative
The Avengers would hate you,negative
"Marvel has been woke for decades, it’s literally the point you fool",negative
"I find it hard to believe the actors wouldn’t have agreed to it if that were the case, so not really rude, they’re still getting paid. Do you think they’d just randomly throw an actors name in there without telling them?",negative
Marvel has tricked us before and I really hope in this case cause the announcement kinda kill some momentum and stake of Thunderbolts.,negative
"I really hope their movie is gonna be good and popular enough to warrant making it an ongoing series with changing line-ups. I would love some more fantastical characters in the team for the second movie, like Abomination for example.",positive
"If so then the team should have had a higher casualty.Also I don't get bringing in Thunderbolts so early in Doomsday,they would have fit more in secret wars.

Considering Doom will be absolutely destroying everyone in Doomsday bringing in the B team in Secret Wars would have fit more as a backup",negative
You shall respect His Infinite Majesty King Hydroflax!,positive
They already did it with The Mandarin. They screwed him up in Iron Man 3 so they just retconned it into being a fake Mandarin and then finally gave us the real Mandarin in Shang Chi.,negative
">You really think that if Marvel kill this Taskmaster they will just do another one like nothing happened?

Honestly? Yes. Neither studio nor the fans are particularly invested in this version of the character. Nobody will think too much about it when another Taskmaster inevitably shows up.",negative
"I feel like you can't really judge a character who spent a whole movie under brainwashing/mind control. Now that she's broken away, maybe she's fun and quippy.",negative
Nope just tired of this shit here ^^. People don’t pay attention then do this shit. That’s all.,negative

Sir you a fool if you think Congressman James Buchanan Barnes is the BACKUP 😂,negative
"Sounds dreadfully convoluted… Why would they do that?  If they cared about Taskmaster, they would have just given the character something to do.  I had hoped that they would give TM a redemption arc like they did with Nebula but it seems that they have already moved on from the character altogether.",negative
"But the thing they wouldn't care about that at all, These are the same people who complained when Masters lose to a Super Solider Serum version of Nat a few years back or when he lost to her in Marvel Avengers and calling that game ""Woke"" for it. It has happen countless time before.",negative
"I don’t think it works tho cus the character is still mute from the explosion. How do you explain her motives without having some stupid text to speech or someone expo-dump like Dreykov did. Taskmaster doing sign language would look rather goofy. Most talking the character does in person is in the middle of a fight, where it wouldn't really be probable. I’d much rather her character be killed off and have someone else take the role afterward. Someone more grounded and less conmected to big level shit like Dreykov and the Black Widow program. I think Taskmaster could be a great villain for someone like Kate Bishop, or Spider-Man with the new directiom seemingly having him more focused on street level stuff.",negative
"also their main power is learning from who they’re fighting and copying their technique 

that doesn’t really work at all when you can’t learn their strengths because they’re superhuman.

"Folks… MCU Taskmaster is not mute… literally ten seconds after Black Widow doses her with the reagent, her first words are “Is he gone?”, referring to Dreykov.

Okay! Doesn’t make it any more likely that Antonia will get swapped out for Tony. Go complain about DEI elsewhere or whatever it is you do on the internet,negative
"The problem is that now that they have written themselves into a corner with Taskmaster being Antonia, not Tony.  90%+ of cinema goers do not know anything about Taskmaster originally being a guy… if they put a guy in her place now it would further muddle a character that most people haven’t invested in anyway… 

If they were going to bring TM back at all after widow, they should have modelled the character after the personality traits that TM fans are looking for. If they aren’t going to do that, they could have at least written her out with a single line saying that she had retired from being a killer and was now living a boring life somewhere.  Bringing her back now just to show that she hadn’t really developed in 8 years and then killing her off within 5 mins feels like pointless cruelty.",negative
">MCU Taskmaster is just a Black Widow wearing a special suit, so far.

I know she got cured of the brainwashing at the end but even then I'd imagine Yelena or Natasha would've had her spent more time with her to be more empathetic and human, and less fuck off-y as Tony would be.",negative
"I can't believe they choose Taskmaster of all characters to be the ""emotional"" consequence lmao. What would Natasha think if she knew the girl she fought so hard for ended up as a shitty merc killing anyone for profit and that probably will die unceremoniously by a ""neck bomb"" or the villain.",negative
I don't want them to die. I just don't want to know their fates even when the movie hasnt come out.,negative

Also, I don't understand the problem with characters being revealed that they ""survive"" a movie. Why would you assume they don't?

I was so excited when he was announced can’t wait to see him again even if its only for a few minutes,positive
"From what I remember he didn’t like the makeup process, but aside from that it sounds like he had a bad experience working with Bryan Singer (big shocker I know). But he’s been canceled for years now so I’m sure Cummings would willingly come back",negative
Please no face tattoos/scarification this time.,negative
"Honestly the one thing I’m a bit disappointed with when it comes to the X-Men cast’s implantation in the MCU so far is that outside of Deadpool they all seem to be from an alternate Earth that’s a more comic accurate version of the Fox universe. 

I get that they are most likely trying not to touch the ending set up by Logan but it’s a bit disappointing that the X-Men we see won’t be the ones many of us grew up with",negative
"His makeup in this will probably look cheap and shitty.
They’ll ditch the dark blue for a brighter ugly blue instead.",negative
I think nightcrawler looked stupid in the X-Men movies so it should be full CG so he can look more like him ,negative
High class comment. Only men of culture will get this reference.,positive
That's fine because cumming is a great actor and the best action scenes with that character were heavily CGI anyway,positive
I'm impressed as to how much time they gave him as a new character in X2 and his White House scene is one of the best in any superhero film (second to the Blood Bath scene in Blade for me!).,positive
Almost a perfect film and *way* ahead of its time as a scathing critique on consumer culture.,positive
The Beast from the Marvels was the best looking live action Beast we’ve seen imo. It’s the first time he didn’t look like a puppet,positive
"X-Men 1-3, X-Men: First Class, X-Men: Days of Future Past.",neutral
I'm predicting they're all going to die to stark doom at the beginning as monica escapes back to her universe to warn everyone.,negative
My bad,negative
"And there's also X-Men Origins: Wolverine (awful), The Wolverine (good), and Logan (great).

Also New Mutants which is completely skippable.",positive
I would like this.. :),positive
"X-Men 1-3, X-Men: First Class and X-Men: Days of Future Past.",neutral
"it was actually a good movie, especially for its time. Right up there with Toby as Spiderman. Pioneers of modern super hero movies.",positive
"I’m with you.  I acknowledge their choice to pivot to Doom but I don’t agree with it. They could have recast Kang easily. As much as I love RDJ, I’m not a fan of him being cast as Doom.  It seems like a “try” for hype because of how bad things faltered.",negative
Dude I can guarantee you when the full cast is announced more than half of the characters are there to get killed by Doom. They have make a point that Doom is the big bad so what better way than to bring characters people love and have Doom just kill them.,negative
"Infinity War had a massive cast aswell and it's one of the best Marvel movies of them all. Bringing back the Russo brothers as directors for the next Avengers movies was a genius move and if anyone can pull this off, it's them.",positive
Thats shitty writing and will only make people mad,negative
"If they kill off Red Guardian, I’m gonna start a riot in the theater. ",negative
Cheers mate. I have enjoyed most of the movies/shows. But I just don’t think they’ve done a good job of building hype for these 2 Avengers movies. Although I’m sure when they release a trailer they will get me. Trailers always get me,positive
"Honestly, thie cast is already very stacked, the only concern I have is the synergy between characters really doesn't have much establishment. Makes me really curious how long this movie will be.",negative
The MCU wiki for Doomsday has Spider-Man listed for Doomsday.,neutral
It's such a big cast already and some of these will definitely be there so yeah.,positive
Maya/Echo will also probably be limited to Disney+ for any future appearances.,neutral
"No Ms Marvel. Please God.
I really want to watch Avengers. Truth be told, the script will be weak AF I'm sure. They should have stayed with Kang. Unless the Beyonders are prominently displayed I'm out. Even if they start out with the Beyonders wiping out the Kang club I still consider that weak, reactive writing. The only good thing is the reboot that's coming. ",negative
That Majors audio of him admitting to strangling his girlfriend just leaked like two weeks ago. There's no way he's coming back,negative
"I also, personally, think it would be bizarre to have Channing Tatum's Gambit and not have Deadpool",negative
It would be bizarre to not have him in it at this point.,negative
That is a an excellent point.,positive
I wonder if the filming delay was accommodate a cast reshuffle due to scheduling conflicts. It would explain a lot of weird holes in the cast. Maybe they decided to same Tom’s storyline entirely for SM4 and SW to avoid the whole stunt double situation.,negative
OP but frankly one of my all time favorite Marvel media characters.,positive
The Young Avengers has been such a slow burn I can't guess when we'll get anything official on it. Given that all the actors linked to it are in their early to late 20s I think there'll be nothing young about them when they finally appear. perhaps they'll just be the New Avengers after Secret Wars.,negative
Bring my man Coulson back!! Those 5 minutes in Captain Marvel don't count especially since they acted like he was going to be one of the main supporting characters. Nuts to that.,negative
"I should have added them, they're perfect candidates to bring back",positive
"I think it would be weirder leaving out Hulk than Spiderman, for Spiderman there's a bit of a narrative excuse but Hulk should be at the heart of things, he's a core Avengers member.",negative
Tbh I was shocked they brought her back for thunderbolts,negative
SeekerVash has a weird compulsive obsession with trying to make people not enjoy The Marvels. It's extremely suspicious.,negative
"The Marvels are very unlikely.  In all of the history of Hollywood, no one has ever lost more than 300 million dollars and had more movies made.


The Marvels are dead last in the list of characters that may appear.",negative
It's the anxiety of it All. Not only you but others who have posted here and social media in general.,negative
"Thor is off-planet, too! That just seems like a lazy excuse, so I hope that's not the one they go with.",negative
"It is odd how many big name drops they did. Under normal circumstances, those characters would’ve been kept under wraps.",negative
Has he blocked you yet? He did me a while ago when he finally got sick of me debunking his lies.,negative
"Nobody reported it therefore it must not exist? Who would even report on it? Reporters aren't allowed on movie sets. There's always the possibility things change or are inaccurate, but just because there's no news about what movie it is doesn't mean there is none",negative
"Not Yet no but he seems to replied to me less and less whenever I called him out on his lies especially his Young Avenger Lies. 

It's sad Now I can predicted who exactly is he rooting for in almost every single Marvel Project now lol.",negative
He hasn't and never has. He just hates it for the Female Heroes being the main heroes.,negative
"Seeing as the dark phoenix storyline hasnt been well received either time they tried it and the character of Jean Grey wasn’t portrayed very well I’m not surprised.

But also this isn’t all the cast. I expect well get Deadpool, Wolverine, Spiderman, Hulk, Doctor Strange, Wong, and Photon at the very least in the next reveal",negative
Another factor could be that she’s simply too powerful. If they are doing an Avengers vs Xmen storyline Jean would destroy most of the avengers except Sentry and maybe Thor.,negative
That would be really interesting. It would be so comic like,positive
Looks great,positive
Endgame style. This movie is gonna be so amazing ,positive
"Yeah very nice, no notes, kinda perfect, can't wait for how Secret Wars will affect this colourway, a yellow to orange transition might look cool",positive
"I know, but he is a mutant who ""awakened his mutation"" in the fox universe. 

Also unrelated, but surprised to see that comment downvoted so much. What did I say wrong??",negative
"People don’t like your idea or the original post so they downvote every comment that has OP next to it. You aren’t super helping your case though, not many of us want Deadpool to die with all his friends as a planet explodes",negative
No way this is actually the reason? That's dumb. Deadpool dying is supposed to raise the stakes of Secret Wars because it's more reason for them to fix it,negative
I don’t want Deadpool to die but also nobody in the MCU cares about Deadpool so why would that incentivize any characters to fix anything?,negative
"Sam will definitely be a big character, also Thor.",positive
"Me too. And the fact that Joaquin and Bucky are both in the film makes me think Sam will have great interactions with both. I loved Brave New World, but I get that some people didn’t. I feel like this is an opportunity to really showcase him again and the Russos clearly love him as a character.",positive
Loki is literally holding the multiverse together right now. He has plenty of reason to be here.,positive
"Doom is wrecking that Xmen universe, sharpish to establish him as a threat. Loki is coming to warn his universe.",negative
hahahaha Namor being included in Wakanda is just the right amount of insulting,negative
'Also here for some reason' is killingg meee,negative
"Do you think there's still a chance for Spider-Man to be in this movie? Feels weird to not have him in it.

I guess they're holding out for him (and the other 3 spideys), Deadpool, Wolverine, Hulk, Dr. Strange, Captain Marvel, Hawkeyes, the Young Avengers, Star-Lord etc for the sequel...",negative
I'm so happy we are getting Shang-Chi again.  One of the best post-endgame movies.  Loved his character and fight choreography.,positive
Old men are getting slaughtered,negative
"The timing on this was pretty intentional…reminding everyone that the Thunderbolts will feature prominently in the next huge Marvel crossover is a great way to get asses in seats for their debut.

*no hate, just sayin’*",positive
Feels like Doom will be manipulating Namor to wage war on Wakanda and other land people,negative
Loki is holding the universes together. That's quite a major plot point.,positive
Fakemaster is 100% dying in thunderbolts now,negative
"The fact that the actual avengers in the avengers movie only has 2 heavy hitters and the others are a guy who got one movie, guy who’s last movie was ass and character who had 2 minor appearances in a show and movie",negative
"They aren’t bringing the X-Men in to get the shit kicked out of them for one minute and twenty seven seconds, especially with the big dick energy Charles and Mags are bringing. If they don’t play a major role, I’m instantly leaving the theater and calling it the worst Marvel project. ",negative
"Damn, now I want to see doom and magneto throw hands. WOuld be a cool battle.",positive
"I'm super intrigued about Talokan and Wakanda, especially in the post Brave New World MCU. I wasn't expecting them to get addressed in Doomsday, but I'm very excited about that prospect.",positive
"We're missing a lot of big names for this to be everyone. Obviously Infinity War didn't have everyone either, but missing Benedict Cumberbatch, Brie Larson, Mark Rufallo, Tatiana Maslany and Tom Holland is very curious. Those are some notable omissions.",negative
This is not the full cast list for Avengers Doomsday. There are more actors who haven't been announced.,neutral
You mean like the 2:11 of Charles they put into MoM before he got his neck snapped. I'm sure they'll be devastated by your review.,negative
"Looks so. Fuckin hell mate, I love Olga. Always wanted her to take on some marvel role",positive
"Oh dip, you’re right. They did say Latvia. 

It’s waaaay too close to Doomsday for that to be a coincidence.  Do you think :

A) it was an accident 

Or

B) they might switch it to Latvia instead of Latveria in the MCU? 

Maybe neither but crazy that they would even say the word Latvia much less make it a recurring thing when it’s so close to Latveria",negative
Bendherdick Cuminsnatch,negative
Bryan Cranston,neutral
Bruh Latvia is a real world country that people are actually from. No way they are gonna fictionalize it and make it Doctor Doom's country that is silly,negative
I thought Shang-Chi was recruited by the end of his movie?,neutral
Bruh I know. So is New York and Kingpin is the Mayor. Which would be silly,negative
Did they miss Paul Rudd’s little chair? Or am I going blind?,negative
What about Tom Holland?,neutral
Is this just a Medley or new theme? Sounds great.,positive
"I know the line between Downey and Tony has always been blurry… but he’s really still giving Stark here. From the facial expressions and body language to the suit and the watch, the whole thing is reading like Stark

Either Doom is a variant in some way, or they are really in trouble because I simply can’t unsee stark",negative
"I’d honestly love that to be the trailer. Have some balls and just do it, it’s all that’s needed and we’re all watching it anyway. Everyone going in with no expectations would be awesome.",positive
Oh well if that’s true still pretty cool they got John to do the announcement music,positive
"Honestly we needed at least one more Avengers movie in this phase. So many characters but only half the Avengers movies (less than half if you consider that Civil War was basically a mini Avengers movie with Ragnarok covering the members who were absent)...

I dun get it",negative
It’s weird to have a multiverse and not have Doctor Strange,negative
Alan Cumming being back is a big deal for me.,positive
James Marsden hopefully get to play the Scott he deserves to be and be badass.,positive
"no chavez,strange,hulk, or marvel is kinda insane spiderman i kinda get since his own movie will be out around that time but damn",negative
Lack of Hawkeye or any of the TV show people making me sad 🥲,negative
"No Spider-Man is wild.

Biggest surprises are probably Alan Cumming (he hated the makeup process, makes me wonder if he'll be CGI) and honestly I didn't think Red Guardian would make it out of Thunderbolts alive.",negative
"I'm more shocked at the ones not announced. Jackman, Evans and Reynolds i can see if they're in it being kept as a surprise for the film but no Strange? Spidey? Storm? Jean? Laura? Daredevil? America? Hulk? Wanda?",negative
MCU if u fuck with god of stories Loki and ruin his perfect ending I will never forgive you,negative
So great to see the OG X-Men listed for this. About time they bring them all back. I hope DP & W also make an appearance in this and has a main role in Secret Wars. 👏,positive
That Reed Richard’s is nightmare fuel,negative
"I kinda hate that they've done this. It sucks out so many cool surprises.

Is it neat knowing Stewart is returning as Xavier? Sure.

But it would have been way cooler if I found out when it happened",negative
"If Xavier dies again I swear. DP3s was good, a bit evil but good. Please leave him be.",negative
This seems like extreme overkill,negative
"There a surprising lack of magic people or magic people adjacent in the cast. No Vision, Strange, or any witch is interesting considering how much they’ve been build up the past few years. 

Yes I know Asguardian magic is present but that’s always felt separated from the Wanda’s and Strange’s of the MCU. 

I feel like this isn’t the whole cast or some characters won’t be revealed at all until the movie releases.",negative
This movie is going to be such a convoluted mess,negative
"Ngl, this looks like a mess. Still missing some key characters like strange, hulk and spiderman",negative
Fox X-Men is disappointing. Unless they are destroyed and we get fresh new actors for ALL of them. Just tired of digging in the nostalgia well to get people to see your movie. I'm sure it'll make sense story wise but it's just tired at this point,negative
"No Doctor Strange, Spiderman, Hulk, Captain Marvel, Monica, Moon Knight, Daredevil, Punisher, Hawkeye is fucking crazy lol

Avengers movie and half the lineup is Thunderbolts scrubs & the X-Men + F4.

Don't tell me the Defenders are gonna sit out another major battle. Are the Young Avengers just chilling somewhere watching shit go down? Eternals?

I know it's early but still.",negative
"Gotta say the only things that truly disappoint  me are no Storm, Rogue or Jean in a film where Magneto, Xavier, Mystique, Cyclops, Gambit, Beast and Nightcrawler are in. If we are going to cover legacy X-Men those 3 are essential outside of Wolverine.",negative
"the lack of female characters is borderline absurd. even if there are more yet to still be announced, only announcing 5 in a group of 25 isn’t anything except a bad look",negative
The thing designs is ugly as hell,negative
"I really hope the Fox X-Men don’t play a big role. I’ve never seen those movies and I shouldn’t be required to watch them for an Avengers movie of all projects.

And I’m worried/confused considering like half the characters they just spent the past 5 years introducing aren’t listed here. But I’m sure there’s secrets they’re keeping from us still.",negative
"No Strange or Spider-Man is crazy, they’re my two favourites",positive
"Kind of feels like it's going to be a jumbled mess that's hard to follow. I hope I'm wrong, but they have a hard time handling complex plots these days.",negative
Why tf is M’baku here?,negative
Low faith for this,negative
"Wow, only 5 female characters.... This cant be everyone, I refuse to believe this is everyone.",negative
Loki becoming required reading puts a smile on my face,positive
They better be surprising us with some characters because this is ass.,negative
They better be surprising us with some characters because this is ass.,negative
"This team is such dog shit. Only 2 strategists, 3 with Xavier.",negative
"I'd be shocked if Peter Parker isn't in it. All three preferably

Hopefully Daredevil gets in it. ""Frank, why do I sense two of you?""",negative
So great to see the OG X-Men listed for this. About time they bring them all back. I hope DP & W also make an appearance in this and has a main role in Secret Wars. 👏,positive
this will prolly be ass asl,negative
Not impressed,negative
Yeah where Spidey?,neutral
When did we get news on the Professor and Erik?,neutral
"So good, and a great sign for Sentry",positive
I guess I should watch the X-Men movies cuz I have no clue who half these people are so I guess I'm feeling underwhelmed from this.,negative
You missed Shuri.,negative
SHANG -CHI MY GOAT FINALLY,positive
"This team is such dog shit. Only 2 strategists, 3 with Xavier.",negative
Biggest surprise here for me is Loki. Perhaps we will get that meet up with Thor!! Old xmen is cool too,positive
Biggest surprise here for me is Loki. Perhaps we will get that meet up with Thor!! Old xmen is cool too,positive
Why’d reed get the sassy “oh no you did int” neck and face,negative
Most of the announced names are there to get straight up murdered by Doom,negative
I’m sort of let down by this,negative
Seeing how all the thunderbolts are here except taskmaster makes me believe she won't make it out alive,negative
I still can’t believe it’s already in production im so hyped!!!,positive
Gambit? Really? Praying for a recast.,negative
"I'm honestly happy that Gambit is appearing in another mcu movie, he deserves it after his film never exited development hell and finally got a chance to shine in Deadpool.  <3",positive
I'm so glad James Marsden is back as Cyclops. Hopefully they do him justice this time.,positive
Ghost is in this but not Wanda?? Fucking hell,negative
"Taskmaster appeared so little in the Thunderbolts* trailers, everyone had already guessed she was going to die early in the movie. Now Marvel just confirmed that she's the *only* Thunderbolt who's going to die",negative
No Moon Knight is very disappointing,negative
WHERE’S DEADPOOL?!?,negative
No She-Hulk 🥺😭😭😭,negative
My guy Deadpool and Wolverine?,neutral
Jesus this makes endgame look like nothing.,negative
"I hope they don’t drag the Thunderbolts into this just to kill them off as canon fodder to up the stakes. 

Such a lame narrative device.",negative
This has me so hype,positive
All of the xman to be killed off like the cameos in MoM. I refuse to have hopes higher than that.,negative
"I even consider here if its good or Bad.
For me personally its a trash cast
But thats a Problem for my own, because ive never could get in touch with xmen. Its Nonsens for me.
Thunderbolts is poorly expect yelena. I love her
The rest is fine.",negative
Is RDJ gonna get first billing?,neutral
"If the death flags for Taskmaster weren't obvious enough from the thunderbolts marketing, her not being with the rest of the thunderbolts here basically confirms she'll die.",negative
"Shout-out to Chris fuckin' Hemsworth, Im glad he's still here.",positive
Man I hope War Machine appears in one of these movies. Been around since Iron Man 2 and he’s always just swept under the rug and forgotten. By far one of the coolest Avengers and yet no love :(,negative
Reed cracked me up :),positive
Taskmasters def dying in The Thunderbolts,negative
can’t believe gi’ah don’t make it /s,negative
"No daredevil?
Whyyyy",negative
"For now Bruce, and Hawkeye are a few of the noticeable omissions from this announcement.",negative
No Hulk fr... the level of disrespect.,negative
"Nat is dead. Cap is back in the past and probably dead or way too old as a result. Tony is dead.


You've got Clint and Hulk left. ",negative
Nightcrawler is my favorite of all time,positive
![gif](giphy|FOXXGURK5NQ7S),neutral
"Hell yes! He was freaking perfect in X2 and I was so pissed we never heard from him again, and then got that lame ass emo crawler in x3.",negative
"Nah, they'll probably take my dude out on the first ten minutes, lol. 

The Last Stand was such a disappointment!",negative
After watching Paradise I’ve become a fan of him and it’s a shame he was sidelined in the X-Men movies,negative
Strange was confirmed previously I believe,neutral
No hawkeye means no win for heroes.. they learned nothing since Thanos..,negative
"With Tunderbolts* and Fantastic Four: First Steps very clearly leading directly into Doomsday now, it's going to do a LOT for cohesion. I feel more excited to see these characters and watch these movies knowing that they'll show up again soon.",positive
"If US Agent and Loki (They played the TVA theme, I'm assuming he's that version) made it in because they've been in the movies, so should've Kamala tbh or even Kate. That said I'm really disappointed about Moon Knight and DD.",negative
No Kate Bishop in either of these Avengers movies would be egregious.,negative
"yea cyclops, prof x, beast, and night crawler but no jean, storm or wolverine was the biggest shocker to me",negative
Sorry buddy but doom is gonna kick his ass and dethrone him,negative
"Two teams in separate universes trying to prevent an incursion with each other which inevitably leads to them fighting and both universes dying. Doom, Reed and some others escape the disaster and show up in Battleworld for Secret Wars.",negative
Cameo porn into Doom committing genocide probably,negative
"I think they are gonna say that new fantastic 4 and X men are from the same universe and in that universe Victor Von doom looks like RDJ
I know it sounds stupid, because it is... but im afraid, if they take any other route it'll be even stupider
and in the last 5 years the only surprise I got from marvel was that it got even more stupider each time
that explains why Mr. Fantastic looks old enough to have RDJ as his Doom
and rest of the cast are all old af too...",negative
Wasn‘t Tom Holland already confirmed and the fact that he will mostly wear his mask during the movie?,neutral
I'll find it very strange if he has a prominent role in the movie while Captain Marvel and Doctor Strange may not be in the movie at all,negative
"I understand other characters having their own thing going on but surely when there’s a threat to the multiverse such as Doom they would make it top priority

Like they can focus on doing their own mission but kinda a waste of time if their universe ends when they could have helped prevent it",negative
Agreed. I wasn't excited at all before now I REALLY don't care,negative
Hulk already doesn't even get his own movies and now he's gonna sit out an Avengers movie? SMH,negative
"That is actually quite sad. Hopefully the numbers even out a bit when/if they announced the cosmic/magic MCU characters. They tend to lean more towards female

Edit: Getting downvoted for saying there should be more female representation is just sad",negative
"That's fine, honestly at this point it's preferable to them including him and then proving for the 6th time in a row that they just, as a company, do not know what the fuck to do with that character and are apparently fully uninterested in trying.",negative
"Bryan Singer seems like a truly awful person. Kinberg, Feige, and the other producers must have put in a lot of work to keep the cast somewhat happy",negative
That scene and Dark Phoenix where he and Quicksilver save almost the entire shuttle crew mid-teleport was such a cool moment.,positive
Best X-men character no question,positive
"Those first two X-Men movies are still my favorite superhero flicks. Perfect performances all around. The Russos + McFeely have proven to be great with character, so I’m really hopeful this is gonna be good.",positive
"X2 was the first superhero movie that I watched in  cinema that I was like “wow, I didn’t know popcorn movie like this could be so good and enjoyable!”- while I knew nothing about marvel or any comic at all.",positive
"The apocalypse was even more of a tragedy. How do you fuck up one.of the greatest villians ever. No build-up, very little apocalypse, and a terrible storyboard. Should've been 2 movies and should have been teased way before.",negative
Sonic trilogy has been a hit and he's a main character in that so yeah I'm glad he's back in this,positive
Oh he was great in Paradise,positive
"You should watch 30 Rock. He doesn’t appear until the last couple seasons, but he is such an happy and wholesome character. And the show is already hilarious so win-win.",positive
The X Men will certainly die,negative
"I doubt they could use Wiccan.  He brings a strong probability of instant banning in around two dozen countries, including China and Middle East.  

They can't afford to lose a single market with this, as their budget is going to be somewhere between 400-600 million with this list of characters and their breakeven is 800m-1.2 billion.  Which they won't hit if they lose China and the Middle East.",negative
"There’s no way they introduce Wiccan to just keep him in tv shows, right?…I hope not",negative
Loki is low key the strongest character here both in terms of power and characterization,positive
Pivotal* my bad,negative
I had no idea about that. That’s really sad she was awesome as Storm,negative
Cameo porn is a damn right way of calling this. I'm not joining the hate train but I'm very skeptical about the quality of the plot.,negative
"Except for Doctor Strange and Hulk, I don't see anyone who should be involved to face a threat like Doom regardless of the ones that are involved, not even Spider-Man or White Vision, if they're keeping Battleworld for Secret Wars, that's probably where everyone would appear",negative
The good guys probably lose in Doomsday. Hence no Clint.,negative
"Yes, Jeremy Renner actually recovered pretty well! He's been posting himself working out. That's good for him that he's recovered so well at that age. I'm wondering if Marvel helped him at all on his journey.",positive
"Unfortunately in Strange's one vision, every human develops a condition shortening their lifespan to about 40 years old. Very sad.",negative
"I rewatched the entire X-Men series to prepare for Deadpool last year and X2 not only holds up but is a top tier superhero film.  I'm being serious, I'd rank it up there with The Dark Knight and Iron Man in terms of quality.",positive
At this point I'd be shocked if we didn't see him. Halle Berry and Famie Jansen are probably showing up too.,negative
"Ah save it.

Edit: Guys I was doing the Wolverine quote :(",negative
"“Only”?! X2 is one the GOATs, come on! That opening scene is peak fucking cinema.",positive
Big ups thanks dawg,positive
"I couldn't finish it.  Glad I didn't pay to see it in the theater.  I've started it twice now and just quit and switched to something else. 

Yeah, they wasted one of the franchise's best villains and the actor they cast for him.",negative
"My main concern with that is, isn't it a bit of a rehash of Multiverse of Madness to bring Patrick Stewart back as Prof X only to just kill him again?",negative
I'm pretty sure other movies just cut relevant scenes if it's a small plot point. Also related but fuck homophobes everywhere (in the ass),negative
"He's already been promoted to movie status (Thunderbolts), I meant it for upcoming shows",neutral
"Loki just needs to mimic Sue, both lay down their ults and Doom's attacks are useless",negative
"Will that Loki be present though? Or one of his variants? I don’t think Time God Loki should show up other than to talk to Thor, because unless Doom has some nasty stuff there’s no way Loki can’t Time-Slip for a billion years",negative
idk he just irritates me. I didn’t like him in FATWS but maybe I won’t hate him so much by the end of Thunderbolts. He just seems to like to eat his own foot because it’s ALWAYS in his mouth,negative
"they forgot about colossus in a movie he was actually in, not surprised to not see him here",negative
"That's the only thing I think it can be called. People seem to be forgetting that RDJ got paid 9 figures for this. Half the screen time is his, and it's actually necessary because Doom is a character that NEEDS to be fleshed out",negative
It's very weird that she wasn't included. Monica literally ended up in the FoX-Men universe as a tease for this very movie. Hope they didn't can her because The Marvels flopped,negative
Same guys think losers like Hawkeye are good but Captain Marvel isn't because she didn't 'smile enough',negative
Obviously. No Clint = Certain defeat,negative
Years of conditioning for action roles absolutely helped out,positive
Well that’s awesome! It was a legitimate question,positive
"That's awesome to hear. I thought that was why he wasn't in it. Granted, I imagine you could have him just showing up and sitting down in most scenes.",positive
"I agree! It’s just an absolutely excellent movie. Memorable set-pieces, compelling themes and performances, and the real climaxes are all small character moments, like Logan turning away from Stryker at the end (while holding the blue tongue boy) or Jean’s final sacrifice.",positive
That was a dope scene,positive
He sure fucking was 😀,positive
All three of them started in the movies. They're talking about characters making the jump from TV,neutral
Would be kinda lame if Loki gets killed yet again in the beginning of a two part Avengers arc.,negative
I'm annoyed they even casted RDJ as a doom variant or as Doom. One of the dumbest fucking moves they could have done.,negative
Man no one's time is worth that much. RDJs ego is off the charts since he's demanding salaries like that,negative
Nah he is just gonna get his ass beat and dethroned by doom,negative
Same with Lashana Lynch. I'm quite surprised that they weren't listed.,negative
This is crazy 😭,negative
This is wildin’ but damn. That’s some good observation.,positive
