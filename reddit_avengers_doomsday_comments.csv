Hawkeye in Doomsday?,Kate is going to be in an Avengers movie so guessing Doomsday for now.  (Hailee accidentally nodded when asked if she’s going to be in an avengers movie),Reddit
Hawkeye in Doomsday?,"Mhmm personally i dont want Hawkeye to die, imo i’d prefer he just pass the mantle down to Kate and she takes over in Doomsday",Reddit

Hawkeye in Doomsday?,"I feel you gotta have him in there, even just for Renner to have a scene as Hawkeye on the farm after his mishap.

Edit - I just realized Hawkeye lives on a farm in Iowa, home of the Hawkeyes lol",Reddit
Hawkeye in Doomsday?,I'm honestly surprised that the only 2/3 remaining OG Avengers weren’t in the cast list.,Reddit
Hawkeye in Doomsday?,GIVE THIS MAN A BREAK,Reddit
Hawkeye in Doomsday?,Nope and that’s why they’re gonna lose. Avengers only win with Hawkeye,Reddit
Hawkeye in Doomsday?,Let him retire already,Reddit

Hawkeye in Doomsday?,"Nah I'm good. Clint had his run. He said he'd retire over 10 years ago chronologically speaking, and he only managed to do so in like 2024. Kate Bishop would be cool though.",Reddit

Hawkeye in Doomsday?,This isn’t Hawkeye. This is Ronin,Reddit

Hawkeye in Doomsday?,"“I retire for what, 5 minutes and it all goes to shit?”",Reddit
Hawkeye in Doomsday?,Rumored but no official announcement.,Reddit
Hawkeye in Doomsday?,"Probably not, because they don't want people to say ""It's Infinity War/Endgame all over again"".

I'm guessing it's a stalemate, they'll start out losing, find a way to grind him to a halt, and then end on a ""Maginot Line"" situation.",Reddit
Hawkeye in Doomsday?,"It's not a Captain America situation. Clint didn't give up the mantle, they are sharing it.",Reddit
Hawkeye in Doomsday?,"Technically, he hasn’t passed on the mantle yet. But I wouldn’t be mad if Kate Bishop were in it, too.",Reddit
Hawkeye in Doomsday?,"Kate Bishop, Hawkette, Lady Hawkeye, Lady Hawkguy",Reddit
Hawkeye in Doomsday?,Please find somewhere else to push your hot takes.,Reddit
Hawkeye in Doomsday?,key word. allegations.,Reddit
Hawkeye in Doomsday?,He will 100% do it and it’ll get hyped as a triumphant return to the role where his character has a big impact,Reddit
Hawkeye in Doomsday?,"He has acted in Mayor of Kingstown since the accident, so maybe just leave all the stunts to his double and Kate.",Reddit
Hawkeye in Doomsday?,"Maybe Hawkeye could capitalize on his prior incarnation and become an inmate advocate for metahumans in The Raft. Less strenuous role, mostly driving and answering his phone…",Reddit
Hawkeye in Doomsday?,">after getting run over by a snowplow

Iirc it was a snow cat, whether it had a plow on it i don't know.",Reddit
Hawkeye in Doomsday?,"I doubt they'll be involved.

1.  Wiccan creates a very high probability of an instant ban in two dozen countries.  Disney can't afford a ban in any countries with how much is riding on the movie.

2.  Ms. Marvel was the lowest viewed MCU show, and then part of the industry's biggest bomb in history.  I doubt she's a priority.

3.  A large part of the reason why the Young Avengers was cancelled was because they were afraid that being called ""Avengers"" would harm the Avengers brand as they have low confidence after The Marvels failed.  They wouldn't then turn around and put them in an Avengers movie.

4.  It's pretty obvious they have very low confidence in Ironheart drawing viewers in that show.

They're going to try for them as an isolated on-ramp for the under 18 demographic as a show, I doubt they'll include them in the mainline universe.",Reddit

Hawkeye in Doomsday?,disturbing lol. yawn,Reddit
Hawkeye in Doomsday?,"[So, it was definitely a snow cat, with a plow on it](https://blog.ansi.org/snowcats/)

Hawkeye in Doomsday?,"You've read the room, the only problem was you could not read",Reddit
Hawkeye in Doomsday?,"No but it was clearly about naming her Hawkeye, it’s at least partially passing the mantle even if Clint will still be Hawkeye himself.",Reddit
Hawkeye in Doomsday?,"I'm not trying to get attention, I'm sharing my opinion.  I don't consider it a hot take to say that him being able to afford health care and time off to recover just highlights how absurd it is that people's lives get ruined for minor injuries because health care has become so hard to access. 

I'm glad he didn't die and was able to recover, I just think it's irresponsible to not talk about the issues this highlights",Reddit

It does not.

Hawkeye in Doomsday?,If it's not about health care then why mention the snow plow accident as if that's something we should admire,Reddit
Hawkeye in Doomsday?,">If it's not about health care then why mention the snow plow accident

My guess on which Marvel character would be in Destin Daniel Cretton's Spider-Man: Brand New Day,Daredevil is the only one that makes sense within the story. Matt was already in NWH.,Reddit
My guess on which Marvel character would be in Destin Daniel Cretton's Spider-Man: Brand New Day,Of these choices Matt feels the most likely.,Reddit
My guess on which Marvel character would be in Destin Daniel Cretton's Spider-Man: Brand New Day,I know it’s part of the deal but I hope they let Spider-man sell this movie mostly on his own. Go for more of a Far From Home approach with MCU characters. They didn’t need a flagship character for that movie to make bank. Spider-man is a big enough draw that they can get away with a lower level MCU character showing up.,Reddit
My guess on which Marvel character would be in Destin Daniel Cretton's Spider-Man: Brand New Day,"Sony want this to be a guranteed 1.5B+ movie and will want to get close to that 2B number. That's going to be hard to do. Previous movies did 900M, 1.3B, and 1.9B. It's hard to follow up No Way Home which saw the previous Spider-Man characters. Sony was rumored to want Spider-Man 4 to also be a multiverse story, but Marvel talked them out of it. 

So if you are Sony, what Marvel characters would help you achieve that box office? Currently, the MCU doesn't have any mega popular options. The Fantastic Four are unproven in the MCU, aren't box office draws, and may not fit story wise because they are in a different universe. So who does that leave?

The X-Men. Sony was able to convince Marvel to introduce the X-Men in Spider-Man 4. Sadie Sink is Jean Grey. The rest of the O5 team will be there with Cyclops, Iceman, Beast, and Angel. 

Spider-Man 4 comes out in July 2026. X-Men comes out in November 2026. 

Doomsday in May 2026 gives us the final main appearance of the FoX-Men. Secret Wars in May 2027 sees the MCU X-Men.",Reddit
My guess on which Marvel character would be in Destin Daniel Cretton's Spider-Man: Brand New Day,"I keep saying this, but I will again because I can:

They will introduce the Venom symbiote suit either here or in Secret Wars, and then when the symbiote finally makes its way to Eddie Brock, or whoever they stand in for him, they are going to have Venom immune to Spider Sense, and then Parker is going to go to Shang Chi to learn the Way of the Spider to compensate for this. 

That's my strong prediction, and based on this, I believe they are going to have Shang Chi introduced to Peter earlier.

I think that will be in this film or Secret Wars, seems like a good idea to team them up in this one.",Reddit

My guess on which Marvel character would be in Destin Daniel Cretton's Spider-Man: Brand New Day,"Spidey has had a mentor figure in every movie he’s in, so my guess would be that Daredevil will be his mentor figure in BND just to keep the trend going. 

I would have originally chosen Shang Chi just cause Shang Chi taught Spidey martial arts in the comics, but MCU Shang Chi is still very much a newbie in the MCU scene so chances of that are low. 

If Shang Chi shows up in BND, it’ll most likely be in an elder-disciple sorta way, not a mentor figure. So more of an older peer like how Andrew and Tobey’s Spideys were to Tom’s Spidey in NWH. 

If they wanna keep the NWH parallels going, I could imagine Spidey teaming up with Shang Chi and Iron Fist with Daredevil as the responsible adult figure, like how Tom teamed up with Tobey and Andrew with Dr Strange put in the responsible-adult position. 

But again, that depends entirely on what the plot of BND will be. At the very least, I think Daredevil will be the responsible adult taking care of Spidey.",Reddit

My guess on which Marvel character would be in Destin Daniel Cretton's Spider-Man: Brand New Day,"It's not going to be Jean Grey because the original Fox Marvel contracts for producers are still in effect that Disney has to pay for since Disney purchased Fox. These are the Fox producers that worked on the X-Men movies that get an Executive Producer credit and a hefty paycheck for doing absolutely nothing on the film. Sony is not going to want to pay that, so that means we will not be seeing any X-Men or mutants debuting in a Sony produced/paid for Marvel Studios film.",Reddit

My guess on which Marvel character would be in Destin Daniel Cretton's Spider-Man: Brand New Day,"So the difference between a Spider-Man film that makes a guarnteed 1.5B and one that makes 1.2B is that Sony doesn't want to pay a producer fee?

Did the Fox producers get a EP credit on The Marvels or Dr Strange Multvierse of Madness?",Reddit
My guess on which Marvel character would be in Destin Daniel Cretton's Spider-Man: Brand New Day,"Two different versions. FoX-Men refers to the characters from the original Fox trilogy in the 2000s (like James Marsden, Patrick Stewart, etc). 

May 2026 - Avengers: Doomsday. Featuring the FoX-Men. 

July 2026 - Spider-Man: Brand New Day. New MCU X-Men. O5 characters, including Sadie Sink as Jean Grey. 

November 2026 - X-Men film. Featuring the O5 characters.

May 2027 - Avengers: Secret Wars. Including the new MCU X-Men. Maybe the FoX-Men are included here too. 

Marvel currently has a film scheduled for Feb 2026 and Nov 2026. We don't know what films that will be, but it's unlikely that the Feb 2026 film is going to happen due to the timeframe. The Nov 2026 film is doable, especially if you already have the casting done.",Reddit

Steve Rogers as Nova in the new Avengers Doomsday (Theory),A John Cena Steve Rodgers variant as Nova would cool. Also Ultimate Cap would be really cool. ,Reddit
Steve Rogers as Nova in the new Avengers Doomsday (Theory),"I think they’re already planning on doing a Richard Rider version of Nova at some point down the line. They had been developing a Nova show just a few months back but it ended up getting delayed when plans changed and they decided to focus solely on multiverse saga stuff. So I don’t see them making Steve Rogers into Nova. 

Especially since he was never actually “Nova” in the comics he momentarily put the helmet on in a time of dire need and used the Nova force to save the universe real quick and then he took it off so he was never actually doing the role of Nova. Just borrowed the powers for a few panels. 

I think the good version of Steve Rogers we’re going to get is the version from the end of Endgame where he’s about to go through time with Mjölnir and all six infinity stones and he’s going to pop up just like that on Battleworld somewhere during Secret Wars. I’d totally freak out in the theater if they decided to do that",Reddit

With how the films line up with the comics, and what logic they’ve introduced, whatever universe Monica Rambeau is in will probably have an incursion with 616, resulting in the X-men presence in the film.

I’d be VERY surprised if Doom doesn’t end up manipulating one or both universe’s heroes to get them to stay busy fighting each other so they don’t focus on him. I mean, the movie after this is secret wars, and the 2015 run ended with an incursion on the main universe and the heroes of both worlds fighting for the survival of their world… 

That… that’s all this is, right? I mean, the pieces are all lined up, the logic is established, and who could forget the staple of the superhero genre…

"Kevin Feige shares new details on 'Avengers: Doomsday' at CinemaCon, confirms filming starts in a few days","Is there any way the movie hits the May 1, 2026 release date if filming hasn't even started yet?

I'm just going off of vibes and not data, but I always assumed the average movie is filmed at least 18 months before release, with something huge like Avengers taking even longer to allow for editing and/or reshoots. Starting filming less than 13 months ahead of release seems super ambitious - I'd rather them take more time to make sure the final product is solid.

e: okay, I was a bit off. For reference:

- Avengers 1 began filming April 25, 2011 and released April 11, 2012 (May 4 in the US)
- Age of Ultron began filming February 11, 2014 and released April 13, 2015 (May 1 in the US)
- Infinity War began filming on January 23, 2017 and released April 23, 2018 (April 27 in the US)

"Kevin Feige shares new details on 'Avengers: Doomsday' at CinemaCon, confirms filming starts in a few days","Those aren't buildup. Those are toys in a box .

The first three phases didn't just introduce characters or concepts, they introduced plot lines *uniting* the characters and showing us what the villain was building towards. Nick fury was the string connecting that first group, and he pulled them together in that movie.

Play Kevin Bacon with this list. Which ones are linked by personal relationships?

Ant man, bucky, and Captain America, maybe?

Or Captain marvel, ms marvel, Elena, and Kate Bishop? Maybe shang chi and dr strange via captain marvel and Wong? Even those are pretty tenuous.

As for the villain - do we know what his basic goal is? We had an idea what it would be for thanos at this point, even just from snippets of the character.

"Kevin Feige shares new details on 'Avengers: Doomsday' at CinemaCon, confirms filming starts in a few days","Yeah, I 100% agree. Secret Wars is the crossover of all crossovers where the stakes cannot be topped and the current MCU just within Earth-616 alone is much bigger than the cast for IW & Endgame with how many characters they’ve added since Phase 4. That’s not factoring in the Legacy cameos (Snipes, the OG FoX-Men like Hugh + Stewart, & Tobey potentially getting a proper send-off as the pillars of the superhero genre in the Avengers crossover they never had), or if they wanna pull variants from classic animated shows, video games, or straight from the comics. 

Not to mention, it’s the event so cataclysmic that it could serve as the end of the Marvel Universe as a whole, but in this case, that’ll probably just mean multiversal soft reboot with all the characters in the same universe & recasts/fresh takes on past characters like the new X-Men and potentially characters we lost in the Infinity Saga who have important relationships with characters or stories we haven’t gotten a chance to see yet.

"Kevin Feige shares new details on 'Avengers: Doomsday' at CinemaCon, confirms filming starts in a few days","Oh you’re right, Infinity Saga had much better build up and it’s definitely not just rose-colored glasses.

We’ve seen the characters unite so much in the Infinity Saga, we had 2.5 Avengers films before Infinity War, and Ragnarok was kind of a team-up too. We haven’t had that level, nor do we need it again, but we have had some of it. And that works for this saga.

We saw little clips of Thanos at the end of Avengers 1 & 2, the first not even related to the infinity stones. We also got a scene in Guardians 1, and his ship appearing in Ragnarok but that was to explicitly tease Infinity War, so I don’t even count that as different bc we may get a similar thing in Fantastic Four. So yeah, we barely saw anything of Thanos pre-Infinity War. Why you’re saying that’s so much different than not seeing Doom at all confuses me. It’s a LITTLE different, but basically it’s not.

Nick Fury was the string for Phase 1 only.

Avengers 1 was the first crossover, not Infinity War. In Avengers 1 they all met for the first time. In Infinity War, different people met as well: Doctor Strange and the Guardians all met the Avengers, everyone met the people of Wakanda and Captain Marvel. This won’t be hugely different in that way either.

The only thing I’ll concede is that we don’t know Doom’s goal, but honestly if we didn’t know Thanos’ goal the fan reaction to Infinity War would’ve been the same.",Reddit

All teams will have been thoroughly introduced, just as they had been before Infinity War.

Doom will be new just like Thanos, and he'll have plenty of time for plot focus.

The movie is yet to even be described. All we have is a partial cast list, which includes the Fox X-Men which (shocker) will appear in a multiverse crossover story, a la every such event in the comics.

Look, love it or hate it, they're concluding the Multiverse saga here, and it only makes sense to utilize characters we already know. It would be way worse to introduce NEW X-Men or variants and waste screentime developing them. This is having your cake and eating it too.

"Kevin Feige shares new details on 'Avengers: Doomsday' at CinemaCon, confirms filming starts in a few days","""introduced"" , I guess, he was, but come on, who knew who and what he was about ?

He was just a big bad figure. People knew he was around, but general audiences very much did not know what he meant. I doubt when people saw him in IW, they were like ""yoo, thats the dude from GoTG""

Us MCU fans and comic fans, we knew, but general audiences were pretty much seeing as a full-fleshed Thanos for the first time in IW. 

  
I do get that Doom has a very rich backstory, and should have been set up much sooner, but I do also think that the Russos and Fiege are approaching this differently.   
The original plan was to have Kang be the big bad and Doom was gonna be sprinkled in.   
So we'd have Kang Dynasty as the next Avengers film, and it would THEN lead into Doomsday. But they had to speed that up now, and so it's caused a bit of movement around. 

Russos have also stated (rumored though) that Tony Stark's death in Endgame is somewhat connected to why he is the character playing Doom. They might find a way to make it link plot wise. I also don't think he's the primary Doom.   
He's likely a multiversal Doom.

We've had multiversal villains before. Peter fought against a Norman Osborne from another universe, who also killed his aunt. Osborne WILL come into the MCU, not played by Willam Dafoe, and Tom Holland Peter will address it.   
  
Same with Doom. We'll see this one play out, and then there will likely be another actor announced as the primary Doom. And he will be the main Doom of the MCU going forward, and the audiences will already know who Doom is based on RDJ's version, so they will get on board with the new one. 



At the end of it all, I'm just putting my faith in the Russos. If its anyone who knows how to adapt comic storylines, the Russos and james Gunn have nearly flawless records. They genuinely love these stories and I'm sure they'll give us a version that works.",Reddit

"Kevin Feige shares new details on 'Avengers: Doomsday' at CinemaCon, confirms filming starts in a few days","It's actually a single frame of every single characters to ever appear in a Marvel property, going so fast that it creates a flipbook-like narrative generating the shifting image of a trans-universal entity fighting Doom, really innovative cinematic experience",Reddit
"Kevin Feige shares new details on 'Avengers: Doomsday' at CinemaCon, confirms filming starts in a few days","But the also have to prep the world for the post Secret Wars MCU reality where likely a main Earth/Universe is home to the Avengers, X-Men, FF, and Spiderman orbit actively at the same time, as opposed to the 90's and MCU up to now.

That's important because in a world where they are all present and available for the MCU to use, when a film chooses to introduce a truly World Ending/Universe Ending Bad Guy, it'd be absurd if elements from all of the main teams weren't involved.

Moving forward, you could have Spiderman solo, as an Avenger or as a F4 member(as in the Hickman run and others).  You could have Wolverine on the Avengers.  You could have the Avengers fighting alongside(or against) the X Men.  Namor both battling Wakanda(once again) while courting Sue Storm. 

 How much of that will happen? Who knows.

"Kevin Feige shares new details on 'Avengers: Doomsday' at CinemaCon, confirms filming starts in a few days","> Oh you’re right, Infinity Saga had much better build up and it’s definitely not just rose-colored glasses.

Correct.

The main groups (Sorcerers, Avengers, Guardians, Wakandans) were each composed of people who knew the others within their own group and had close working relationships with them. The Avengers and Wakandans also had connections, so we essentially just needed to introduce the Sorcerers, Avengers, and Guardians to each other. It wasn't highlighted in the film, but Ragnarok showed us that Strange was familiar with at least Thor and was keeping an eye on cosmic events in his area, so he had a good reason to get involved.

> We saw little clips of Thanos at the end of Avengers 1 & 2, the first not even related to the infinity stones

The first time we saw Thanos, we knew for absolute certain that he was after the Tesseract. The second, we knew for absolute certain he was after the Power Stone. We knew *very* early on that Thanos was trying to collect these powerful objects, and in Guardians of the Galaxy, they explain what exactly the objects are and what they're for.

> Why you’re saying that’s so much different than not seeing Doom at all confuses me. It’s a LITTLE different, but basically it’s not.

Here's the question I asked:

> do we know what his basic goal is?

Based *solely* on the movies, not any knowledge of the comic storylines, do you know what Doom's deal is or what his goal is?

> Nick Fury was the string for Phase 1 only.

Correct.

> In Avengers 1 they all met for the first time.

Incorrect. Iron Man already had Tony connect with Coulson and Nick Fury, and *specifically sets up the idea of collecting powered individuals*. Hulk had Tony interacting with Hulk's story, showing he was on SHIELD's radar. Captain America had Steve connect with Nick Fury. Thor had Thor connect with Hawkeye and Nick Fury, and also gave us insight on Loki. Iron Man 2 had Tony also meet Natasha.

So before we had Avengers, all of these characters had connections to the Nick Fury, and we were told that Nick wanted to collect them into a team. And then we saw him do that in Avengers. That's buildup and payoff. We had a villain who we were already familiar with, and knew what his basic goal was (to conquer Earth and prove his worth to Odin).

In Avengers, the entire group assembles *as a whole* for the first time. But the previous movies had already shown them connecting and giving us a *reason* for them to team up in a crossover movie.

EDIT: Correction. Thor the Dark World revealed that the Tesseract was the Space Stone and the Aether was the an Infinity Stone, implying that that's why Thanos sought the Tesseract, and specifies that powerhungry individuals would want all six. So we had a firm grasp of Thanos's end goal as early as Thor 2.",Reddit

‘X-Men’ Star Halle Berry Shuts Down Hopes She Might Return as Storm for ‘Avengers: Doomsday’: “Keep Waiting. Not Gonna Be There.”,"My query with this is less related to Halle Berry - who I honestly have never thought is a good enough actress to warrant the love for her portrayal of Storm - and more about the character.

If they bring back Cyclops, Professor X, Beast, Jean, and whoever else, then Storm is gonna be a big gaping hole in the narrative. I guess they could just say she died, or retired, or lost her powers, or something else entirely, but still. Awkward if the character isn't there.

However they obviously cut all the Toad lines and only kept hers- which didn’t really make sense. 

(When I watched it as a kid though seeing my favorite X-Men finally DO something made me so happy at the time).

New Disney+ “channels” that play decades, mixing tv and movies from the 80’s, 90’s, 00’s, and 10’s to make it feel like Disney channel. I don’t expect this for *Cinemacon* but if they could just throw out that they’re working on it via tweet or something that’d be nice.

Star Wars Rey movie title, do not call it episode 10, not because it’ll piss off the nerds but because I like the clean trilogy numbering we have going.

What’s next for Star Wars after Mandoleron and Grogu ends the show?

PSA: Disney's Panel at CinemaCon is in 11 hours (2:30 PM PT),"We may not have a confirmed roadmap, and there's a high chance Marvel Studios doesn't either, as they are putting all their resources into finishing this Saga with a bang, but we do know more than you think.

We know that X-Men and Black Panther 3 are actively being written right now and there's a rumour that BP3 will be released in February 2028, while X-Men will most likely be the first movie of the saga in July 2027, right after Secret Wars. Michael Lesslie has been writing the X-Men film ever since October 2023, while Ryan Coogler has been writing BP3 and is also writing a role specifically for Denzel Washington.

We also know that Shang-Chi 2 has been in development since the first movie came out, but was stalled due to Destin being preoccupied, at first with Kang Dynasty and now with Spider-Man 4. There's a high chance this movie still happens and rumour has it Destin's pitch involves Randall Park's Agent Jimmy Woo as a co-star and the introduction of the Agents of Atlas in the MCU, while also tying up the loose ends from the first movie.

Other sequels like Captain Marvel 3, Ant-Man 4, Eternals 2 (and very likely Thor 5) which were in discussions prior to their large overhaul 2 years ago, are not in development anymore, while Dr. Strange 3 will most likely still happen, but we don't know when. Current reports say that while Marvel has had pitches and ideas thrown out ever since MoM came out, and there was once a plan to have it come out between Doomsday and SW, they currently don't have a plan set in stone.

Blade and Armor Wars on the other hand, which have been in development hell forever seem to not be happening at all, and there are rumours that Marvel will instead move forward with the Midnight Suns movie they reportedly have been developing for the last few years, and will just debut Blade there instead. 

On the series side, Brad Winderbaum has said that while Marvel is not moving forward with second seasons for Moon Knight, She-Hulk and Ms. Marvel, they are currently exploring a way to make Hawkeye Season 2, with the rumoured pitch that they are looking into right now being inspired by Die-Hard with Clint and Kate stuck in a building during Christmas, having to fight off assassins and the main villain being Clint's brother, Barney, aka Trickshot.

Brad has also said that they will only greenlight series which have the potential to continue for more than 1 season, and preferably series which they can release 1 season per year. X-Men '97 and YFNSM are such series which already have second seasons coming out next year and third seasons already deep in development, probably coming in 2027.

And that's why they put series like Nova, Strange Academy and Terror Inc. on hold (because they don't have multi-season plans for them yet). My opinion is that Nova will turn into a movie to have a higher budget, while Strange Academy will come out after Dr. Strange 3, whenever that is, and will most likely be Disney's answer to Max's Harry Potter series.

Another project which has long been in development (ever since 2021) is a Disney+ series produced by Scarlett Johansson, which rumours say is ""Blonde Phantom"". This might be the only exception of a series which will not run for multiple seasons, since it seems like something they are contractually obligated to make after Scarlett's lawsuit in 2021.

Finally, there are 2 more series rumoured to be in active development, even AFTER the company's overhaul in 2023, which probably means they likely have faith in them and probably already have plans for them to last for many years. These are a Wakanda live-action series  developed by Coogler and a Champions series, which I'm expecting will be developed by Jac Schaeffer.

Series which were reportedly in development prior to the overhaul and haven't been heard of in the rumour-mill ever since 2023 are Wiccan (which has reportedly been merged with Vision), Iron Fist (animated, continuation of Eyes of Wakanda, starring Jenora), White Tiger (starring Angela of course), Daughters of Liberty and MI13 (starring Emilia Clarke, Kit Harrington and Olivia Colman).",Reddit

The Xmen will likely be cannon fodder to Doom and/or the incursion to show some scale/make things more impactful without killing main MCU guys.  It will serve as a final send off to the majority of them. I see some going to Secret Wars, namely Gambit and Wolverine, but this will likely be the last time we see McKellan, Stewart, or Marsden, so I hope it's a worthwhile send off. I don't see any of the Fox characters continuing after Secret Wars, except for Tatum maybe since he's the freshest.

Fox stuff meant a lot to a lot of folks. Gonna suck if they don't do it right. I was someone who didn't want to see Jackman again after Logan. I didn't exactly hate DeadPool & Wolverine, but that's purely dependent on how they actually end his story this time, as well as the Xmen.",Reddit

The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"I think the event they debut in and the fact that it's basically ALL of them cements one thing to me.

The Fox X-Men ARE the MCU X-Men.

I think it's gonna be like a Deadpool 3 situation where these aren't the same ones from the movies, but are actually variants played by the same actors from another universe where they have comic accurate outfits (Maybe theyre the X-Men '97 crew). And also like a Fantastic Four situation where Marvel knows the team needs to be veterans just like the Avengers, so they originate from another universe.

Just like how at the end of Secret Wars, the Ultimate universe fused with 616 and we got Miles and stuff in the mainline, this time the X-Men & F4 Universes will fuse with MCU616 and we'll get those groups added to the sacred timeline. That's why Loki is there. To do his God of Stories thing and weave the threads of those multiverses together to save them from individual annihilation.

Post Secret Wars, we'll have Cumming Nightcrawler, Channing Gambit, McKellen Magneto, Stewart Professor, Marsden Cyclops, Grammar Beast, Romjin Mystique, Reynolds Deadpool, Hildebrand Negasonic, Jackman Wolverine, & Kapičić Colossus as our X-Men.",Reddit

The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"They're not doing a redux of Infinity War. That's actually cheap and only perpetuate the idea that FoX-Men keep getting wasted again.

Them getting equal billing as Thunderbolts\* and Fantastic Four gives pretty much a big hint that there will be three different POVs. One from T-bolts\* rep MCU, one from X-Men rep Fox-verse and one from Fantastic Four trying to solve the final incursion before Doom (and then fails).",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"While I obviously agree that this could happen, I do think this is the least likely of the four scenarios I mentioned, because they will probably want these characters in Secret Wars as well. Although I guess they could just bring in more variants lol",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"I doubt that. Deadpool & Wolverine made over a billion dollars at the Box Office, compared to Brave New World’s measly 400 million.",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"Deadpool & Wolverine made over a billion dollars at the Box Office, compared to Brave New World’s measly 400 million. 

Why focus on the less popular characters like Sam Wilson over Wolverine?",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"This is the multiverse saga, and they already did an entire movie about characters established out of the MCU that became one of the highest grossing MCU movies. Deadpool & Wolverine.",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,The Guardians of Galaxy weren’t Avengers either and Deadpool & Wolverine made over a billion dollars at the Box Office. So that isn’t a strong argument.,Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"I agree. They will likely de-age Ian and Patrick, but they are a bit too old/stiff to play these parts in a battle scene and make it look cool.",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,This is RDJ's movie much like the villain in the story Oppenheimer. lol,Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"Deadpool & Wolverine made over a billion dollars at the Box Office, dude. So why do you think that?",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"Disagree.
You don’t bring in a whole other universe into an Incursion story, let alone set that story up in The Marvels where one of the main characters is trapped in that world, just to kill everyone off after two seconds.

I don’t know if I’d expect McKellen and Stewart to be game for Secret Wars, though.",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"Agreed they are cannon fodder, but god I hope it's actually used substantially, not just in the first act. I'd say it's likely you will see their perspective of the incursion all the way up until the end of Doomsday when it happens, some dying in Doomsday, and most, if not all, dying by the end of Secret Wars.",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"dont know why this is being downvoted, this is the correct answer.",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"I think his character would have been depicted differently had he not been brought in as a funny cameo in D&W. And being in Doomsday, he could very well be a variant, where we get a more serious version he likely would have done if his passion project ever got made.",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"No, the Avengers and the X-Men are going to fight via incursion. Similar thing happened in the Secret Wars comic.",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"And to push Dooms role further, I can see him pitting the two groups against each other. Presenting himself as a Saviour to both, and manipulating them into conflict with each other. And then the Fantastic Four can be the ones who don't buy into it, going directly against him since he is their villain first.",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"I thought the Fantastic Four are on a separate world on their own, different from the Avengers and the XMen.",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,Always felt like Doomsday was a decent alternative to “Time Runs Out”,Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,I mean we also have the fantastic 4 universe so it may be there are 3 or even more universes colliding.,Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"Multiverse collapse into Incursions

Two universes collide, one must destroy the other’s earth or both will die

Eventually the collapse came down to 616(main universe) vs 1610(ultimate)

Whereas 1610 was perfectly willing to destroy 616, the main universes Avengers wasn’t willing to kill billions of people, even if it meant saving trillions. (X-Men however were gonna straight Phoenix-nuke 1610)",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,Probably just Deadpool.,Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,Actual AvX stories aren’t ever really that good. This is the best reason for them to fight.,Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,With the multiverse shenanigans going on in Deadpool & Wolverine I won’t be shocked at all if it’s alternate universe X-Men with 90s costumes.,Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,It's almost certainly the X-Men from the Universe we see in The Marvels. Binary (Maria) will probably be part of the second wave of casting.,Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"Yeah, everything after DoFP follows that continuity. A continuity where Mystique dies (Dark Phoenix) so hmm...",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"They're important, but they're at the end of their story (at least most of these actors are). It would be dumb to kill them in the first act, but none of them are likely returning after this.",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"I don’t doubt that *some* of them will die (I think there will be a lot of deaths in the film), but the idea that they’d bring these legendary actors back just to be jobbers for Doom, is absolutely ridiculous.",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"Well, Doom doesn’t cause the incursions, if that’s what you mean. He saves everyone from them and creates his own world.

He’ll probably do the same at the end of Doomsday.",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,Yes absolutely no build up and with an non existent avengers line up,Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,![gif](giphy|kfAPD1BmVeIf3OUIm2),Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"Yeah it’s the multiverse saga, hence why they are showing up at all. 

Was that movie titled Avengers? Did a single MCU established character even show up in that movie? No and no.",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"Guardians were directly tied to Thanos though, plus the MCU was infinitely smaller back then with a coherent direction. Again I’m not arguing against them showing up, I’m just saying they shouldn’t be focal points of the story. The MCU established characters should be the focus imo. Thats at least what I want to see.",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,I’m perfectly fine with that. It worked for Infinity War and it’ll work again.,Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,Because this many characters are not going to have a sizable role in a 2 hr-ish movie.,Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"I didn't read that one. It's the 2015 Secret Wars series?

I think this group will die as a cameo because I think the MCU will start with a fresh new cast of X-Men for 616.",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,My working RDJ-as-Doom theory is that Doom uses his likeness to Tony to convince the 616 heroes to help him - obviously lying about what he's really up to - and the X-Men come to stop them.,Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"I think they probably start that way, but they’ll wind up on MCU earth through shenanigans",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,1610 being totally willing sounds so extremely accurate LOL I’m not done reading that universe but I know that verse is cooked,Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"Honestly the “best” thing to come from AvX was Namor flooding Wakanda and creating a beef with Black Panther to be seen in Hickman’s *New Avengers* and *Time Runs Out*

But we already got that flood in *Wakanda Forever*",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,But with this pathetic line up?,Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"Agreed.
My 2 cents…
The multiverse is collapsing / merging. At the end of F4 Reed will save the people of his world before it gets destroyed and somehow merges them or moves them into main mcu / 616 / avengers earth. 
Most other earths/ timelines will get culled.
The remaining earths will be this main mcu one and the x-men universe that Rambeau entered at the end of Marvels. This will be the cinematic version of X-men 90 and not a version of the complicated fox verse. 
Not sure how Deadpool, Wolverine and friends fit into that given that it’s implied they are to be merged into the main MCU at the end of DvW.",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"Definitely, The question is whether this universe is earth 10005 or not, Considering Kevin Feige just confirmed they're the original xmen I'm guessing it's most likely the post dofp version of earth 10005 which we get a glimpse at the end of dofp",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,I think they will return in the Secret War as Dooms Day (You mean just 'one day?') is a set up for Xmen vs Avengers vs F4.,Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,I'm with you on this one.,Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"Think they're saying that if this was actually in any way an X-Men v avengers adaptation, they would call the movie X-Men v avengers. Like how cap 3 was named Civil War and not after the main villain.",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"Happy Hogan. The TVA. Very brief cameo from Hulk. Photo and mention of Tony Stark. Deadpool wants to join the Avengers, who get name dropped multiple times. Shot of the Avengers from Age of Ultron shown to Deadpool on TVA monitor. Shot of Thor crying over Deadpool with running joke about why was Thor crying. Defaced Avengers flag seen in the void. Cassandra Nova’s base is inside a giant Ant-Man skull. Cassandra Nova uses Doctor Strange’s sling ring.",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"Deadpool & Wolverine was directly tied to the multiverse. The TVA even said they needed Deadpool’s help for something big in the future.

Most of the other MCU movies in the recent years are way less tied. They are going to have the Avengers and the X-Men fight, and it is going to be an adaptation of the battle between the 616 universe and the ultimate universe from the Secret Wars comic.",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"I agree. I don’t think the FoX-Men should be anything more than nostalgia-pop cameos, not the focal point. ",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"I don't get why people are not getting this. RDJ is promoting as if this were an Iron Man movie. Dr. Doom is not his Thanos, it's his Joker. This is his movie. 

You might have noticed too that the Avengers actors are spread throughout the cast lineup, which gives the impression that they're not THE stars, but just one of the stars in the movie.",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,Infinity War had that many characters/teams.,Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"Deadpool & Wolverine made over a billion dollars at the Box Office. So Marvel going to double-down on that. No offense, I honestly don’t see why you think otherwise given the nature of Hollywood.",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"I was thinking something similar. That it's just a multiversal coincidence that he looks like Tony. But on discovering that resemblance, he uses it to his advantage.",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"It would also be an interesting approach if they had him acting as a Tony Stark to the Avengers - while being himself (as in just Doom) to the X-Men. That way he could easly avoid them finding out about his plan and actions - while sort of staying in the shadows of the whole event.

Edit: update from Kevin Feigi [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/s/hDQ7YWl4UN)",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,I honestly wouldn't be surprised if the F4 will fail to stop Galactus and at the end of the film they are going to leave their Universe with some kind of a machine built by Reed (especially since he's usually the one to figure out Multiversal Travel in the Comics).,Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"Wait until you meet The Maker, probably one of my fav villains of the 21st Century",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"We already know that this is not a full casting list and that more will be added at a later date. The names that we have for now are most likely just the actors who will be filming on set soon, so Marvel revealed their involvement to avoid any fake leaks or rumours about the movie's production...",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,">Not sure how Deadpool, Wolverine and friends fit into that given that it’s implied they are to be merged into the main MCU at the end of DvW.

It could be that more Universes will get pulled into this but at a smaller scale - something like only the characters showing up, but not their entire worlds.",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,Yeah good point on Happy I forgot about him in that movie. Everything else you mentioned is useless crap to get people in seats.,Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,I still prefer option 4,Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,Infinity War had the amount of the *first* cast reveal. There’s going to be even more still to be announced.,Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"Let’s see. Sir Patrick Stewart and Ian Mccallan are like 90. They still have a lot of nostalgia value and can sell tickets but they can’t be the main X-Men cast. 

Just my opinion on it. ",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"I think it will be an intentional deception - he makes himself look like Tony (a variant) via tech/magic to manipulate them

To that point Doom doesnt actually look like Tony, we just never see his ""real"" face. Sort of like with Talos and Mendelsohn also playing the Shield guy who he impersonates.",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,That machine could also be what saves the Avengers when they fail in Doomsday. I like this theory,Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"And it worked. Again, to the point that a movie (almost) solely about multiverse characters became one of their highest grossing.

And Wade wanting to join the avengers on the sacred timeline and then being given the opportunity by the TVA and denying it to be a hero is literally the entire movie.",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,You do really believe the X-Men *need* Professor X and Magneto? Deadpool & Wolverine made over a billion dollars without them. Marvel just retire those characters like they have with many other characters.,Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,I really dont understand what point you’re trying to make but whatever,Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"Professor X is a central character to the X-Men. Your first response to my theory was citing source material. Marvel does try to follow source material so yes, they’re quite necessary characters. ",Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,Captain America and Iron Man are central characters to the Avengers. Yet Marvel retired them. So that isn’t a strong argument.,Reddit
The X-Men’s role in Avengers: Doomsday,"There was just a new Captain America movie. I know different guy but they’re trying to make them the same. They only retired them because they ran through the storyline and actors in a decade. 

Iron man might be back in Doomsday",Reddit

Pedro Pascal celebrates his 50th BDay on the set of “Avengers: Doomsday”,"From what I've seen the only problem people have with Pascal is the same with other current major actors like Chris Pratt*; he's everywhere.

Because he's suddenly in a really good show/film all these studios want to attach him to their nest big project and that creates a specific fatigue towards the actor from people who don't *always want* to see them in everything.

That's just from what I understand though and I don't have a problem with Pascal. I think he's pretty decent and I'm happy to learn that he's in an upcoming project. The man can act, so let him fucking act.

*I just want to point out that this is the only problem Pascal shares with Pratt and the latter definitely has other issues that make people hate him.

X-Men Problem,"I personally think they should have waited for the new X-Men, but it seems like they’re going for an X-Men vs Avengers type thing. 

The Multiverse Saga has been a disjointed mess and while I think they can end it on a high note it’ll still probably feel disjointed.

X-Men Problem,"I think they’re going for like a passing of the torch thing here. A lot of us older fans have wanted to see the original castings one last time for closure. I’m personally excited for it as long as it’s done well. 

With the multiverse it’s very easy to implement a new cast after. Who knows what all the events with Doom and the TVA open up. 

I also saw a theory that we will see Wanda attempting the no more mutants spell, something goes wrong changing the spell, and it actually introduces more mutants.

X-Men Problem,"Honestly they should just use the original cast and get REAL writers and create a last gasp of this world. Finish as strong as endgame. Then reboot the whole thing, more grounded for heroes who are unpowered and more crazy for hulks and thors and try the whole thing again. Crazy like invincible level collateral damage.

It would really have to take a different but just as compelling tone to work, which is of course easier said than done.",Reddit
X-Men Problem,"General audiences are fine with recasting and rebooting, we've seen this time and time again. As long as the quality is good, that's all that matters.

Why I'm more excited about Thunderbolts than Avengers: Doomsday,"Doomsday has no ground work done. Doom is coming out of nowhere. They have a huge cast of heroes who most don’t know each other because since endgame none of them have interacted when they really should have.

Guardians n Thor should have been a real thing not a pissed away cameo.

No high hopes they don’t focus on getting their scripts solid",Reddit
Why I'm more excited about Thunderbolts than Avengers: Doomsday,"Seeing these characters who've appeared in the previous movies and shows teaming up together is so cool. We know who they are, although to see their dynamics mesh together as a team is something I'm excited to see.",Reddit
Why I'm more excited about Thunderbolts than Avengers: Doomsday,"I feel like Doomsday will be the forming of the new Avengers. Thats how it was done for Avengers 1. So yes I am looking forward to Doomsday. Thunderbolts seem ok but extremely predictable and I think itll be just like a mindless watch, similar thing to Black Widow movie.",Reddit
Why I'm more excited about Thunderbolts than Avengers: Doomsday,"I was thinking the other day about just how hyped I’d be if someone told me there’s going to be a big Avengers movie with *Doom* as the villain. Showing more heroes than we’ve ever seen before and having Doom being the central figure? Honestly, I can’t think of anything else in the MCU that would make me more hyped.

But I just…don’t really feel much about it. That’s because RDJ is Doom. I thought I was pretty neutral on the decision to cast him until I kinda realised that. RDJ Doom isn’t going to stick around post secret wars, so it just feels very…gimmicky. It just feels like Doom should be done properly, and this just doesn’t like it’ll be it.

I’ve obviously not seen the film, and I’ll enthusiastically eat my words if I’m wrong, but my feelings at the moment are that it’s really not what I wanted them to do with the thing I’ve been waiting years for.

I don’t really have any expectations of Thunderbolts. It looks fun, I like the characters, and it feels the closest we’ve had to an Avengers film since Endgame. The joy of the MCU was seeing all these characters you’ve been seeing in different films interact with each other for the first time. We haven’t really got anything like that since Endgame.",Reddit

Why I'm more excited about Thunderbolts than Avengers: Doomsday,"They really should do more well written small team stuff. Something b/w 2-6 characters.

Hopefully Thunderbolts goes well and they do more of smaller teamups.",Reddit
Why I'm more excited about Thunderbolts than Avengers: Doomsday,"Yeah we need more movies like Captain America civil war. Not everyone, but a good size group of people from different corners is in the same movie tackling some problem, and giving us connective tissue and giving us an update on the status quo. We need more of that. Everyone being in their own corner for 10 years and then meeting up in this big big movie everyone has to be in is something I don't like. Makes it feel more like 10 movies + a crossover movie, instead of an ongoing cinematic universe.",Reddit
Why I'm more excited about Thunderbolts than Avengers: Doomsday,"I don’t necessarily disagree with this but I also don’t think Doomsday is going to be a big stacked everyone-charging-into-battle movie either.

You can't possibly be excited for Thunderbolts without seeing all of these projects. The no. projects that precede Doomsday directly are less but not non existent",Reddit
Why I'm more excited about Thunderbolts than Avengers: Doomsday,"Not feeling Doomsday yet because there's no story leading into it and I don't care for old cameos for defunct film series. I think I'll be more interested after F4.

Why I'm more excited about Thunderbolts than Avengers: Doomsday,"I really don’t understand their direction. Obviously everything regarding the multiverse revolved around kang which was of course derailed, but I would have thought they would somewhat hint towards Doom. Thanos was teased as early as 2012 with him actually appearing in like 2018. While I think Doom is cooler than Kang, I would hate them having to do an Origin story in the midst of an Avenger’s movie.",Reddit
Why I'm more excited about Thunderbolts than Avengers: Doomsday,There's a rumor that the script isn't finished. Which I find believable.,Reddit
Why I'm more excited about Thunderbolts than Avengers: Doomsday,"While I'm not hyped for Doomsday, I don't really get this argument. Honestly, I feel people overstate the Ground work of Avengers films.

Avengers 1 had nothing more than a tease in Iron Man 2 and Loki set up, fair enough. Along with the heroes that would appear.

Age of Ultron had nothing. I guess Winter Soldier set the opening in motion, but that's literally all.

My point is, there's still time for Thunderbolts and Fantastic Four to give plenty of set up.

Admittedly they're going much bigger than those first two Avengers though.",Reddit

In fact, I wasn't excited because every project you mentioned except for Wakanda Forever was terrible. The trailers are what got me interested.

You do realize people used to just release big team movies like X-Men without needing six solo movies teasing it.",Reddit

Why I'm more excited about Thunderbolts than Avengers: Doomsday,Sounds bs to me,Reddit
Why I'm more excited about Thunderbolts than Avengers: Doomsday,"So you loved the Thunderbolts* trailers. Ok. Wait a few months and you would get a trailer for Doomsday. That is if you're getting hyped for Thunderbolts* purely because of trailers which is apparently not the case but you made a point of mentioning it anyway.

People got excited for X Men cause it's kinda the first of its kind, there were some big names associated with it, the plot works without any prior movies. And a lot of people didn't get excited by it.

I'm just saying there's a chance you would be more excited if you maybe saw F4. I'm not saying you would but there's a chance.

>To say I couldn't possibly be excited about a movie without needing to see a bunch of stuff beforehand is ridiculous.

Do you honestly expect me to believe that someone who didn't see a single MCU project would be more excited for Thunderbolts* and not Doomsday?

I said ""excited"" too many times. My head hurts

I get why you're excited for Thunderbolts*. I am too. But certainly not as much as Doomsday. I hope it's a good movie :)",Reddit
Why I'm more excited about Thunderbolts than Avengers: Doomsday,I believe it. Sounds right in line with how Feige and co has operated in the past.,Reddit
Why I'm more excited about Thunderbolts than Avengers: Doomsday,"That depends on the trailer for Doomsday. Maybe it'll be good, but its not normal for the MCU to have great trailers anymore, so I'm not expecting it to.

I'm excited for Thunderbolts specifically because the trailers did what I didn't expect.",Reddit
Why I'm more excited about Thunderbolts than Avengers: Doomsday,"Ok I agree. I don't usually watch trailers.

Just out of curiosity if they were equivalent(not equal) to IW and EG trailers you would be jazzed for Doomsday. Is that it?",Reddit
Why I'm more excited about Thunderbolts than Avengers: Doomsday,"Unlikely. Infinity War had three characters with solid trilogies heading it up, with a core team of six who had two, arguably three movies of established team dynamics and relationships, and a crossover with the Guardians who had one of the best movies in the MCU to date.

Doomsday has Thor and.... umm.

I guess if Thunderbolts and Fantastic 4 are both hits I might be interested in seeing these characters interact, but none of them are going to be as developed as the original trio were by Infinity War. Right now it's literally just Thor worth getting excited for. Or at least I would be if Love and Thunder hadn't made the character unbearably annoying.

I'm sick of the Fox X-Men, we've literally watched this version of Professor X die three times over. I'm just annoyed we're not getting a rebooted MCU version like they're doing with Fantastic Four.

Shang Chi's not that interesting. And the RDJ Dr Doom thing is stupid, and has done nothing more than put me off this film.",Reddit

BNW is sequel to FATWS, but not in the same way, same is the case with MoM WandaVision, The Marvels and Mrs. Marvels. These along with Loki's two seasons and Deadpool and Wolverine just take the story forward, but aren't true sequels by themselves. 

Unless Dr Strange 3 is announced, BND is the only sequel of the Entire Multiverse Saga.",Reddit

This is going to be the only sequel in the entire Multiverse Saga.,"It is almost sad that we never got sequels in this Saga until now. They went a bit too far with the diversity. I feel like we should've definitely gotten at least a Shang-Chi sequel by now, considering that he is one of the most loved characters introduced in this Saga among the fans.

I really hope they can make a Doctor Strange 3 sometime in between Doomsday and Secret Wars even if it is not that exact November 2026 slot, but it will definitely be really hard to watch over it especially with three huge movies like Doomsday, Brand New Day and Secret Wars all being produced almost back-to-back, without any breathers. Maybe sometime early 2027 like the usual February slots of recent movies. I really think it would make sense and really add to the Multiverse Saga. The infamous rumored title ""Doctor Strange: Time Runs Out"" would be the perfect way to set up Doctor Strange as a pivotal character, more than he already has been established. If the route they are going is Battleworld at the end of Doomsday, then I want to see Stephen actually deal with the repercussions of the destruction of the Multiverse.

If they go a different route and make it so that he actually isn't part of Doomsday and that this movie takes place parallel to the events of Doomsday, then I want to see him explore the Multiverse and witness live Incursions instead of talking about them. I want to see him fix incursions alongside Clea and actually serve as a key member of the Avengers, providing actual Multiversal insight instead of cooking up something on the spot like in Infinity War with the Time Stone.

There are rumors that this Secret November 202t Slot will be one of Doctor Strange 3, Thor 5 or Shang-Chi 2. And I think this will be the perfect sequel to take up that slot and probably will have the best connections to Avengers: Secret Wars.",Reddit

This is going to be the only sequel in the entire Multiverse Saga.,"Honestly, by definition, most films in the MCU are sequels of another because they are connected to the same world and, therefore, continuations of a story.

This is going to be the only sequel in the entire Multiverse Saga.,"Brand New Day will be the second sequel in the multiverse saga, after No Way Home was released as the sequel to Far From Home.

People forget that Far From Home was part of the multiverse saga. But the plotline is based on Tony Stark being dead, which happened at the conclusion to the previous saga (infinity).


Also, Agatha All Along can be argued as a sequel to Wandavision. It's true that the title doesn't mention that, and neither of the two main characters are involved (a motionless dead body isn't a character but scenary).  However, the storyline of Agatha is exactly a continuation of Wandavision, as both the lead characters were introduced there. It's not merely a separate story that happens later. ",Reddit

It is possible he could film Dr Strange 3 and Secret Wars at the same time though.

Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is seven seasons. But obviously there is a difference as to the connectivity from pre-Disney+ and now. There is also a difference in TV Shows (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Agent Carter and Loki) and Limited Time Series (Wandavision & Falcon and the Winter Solider).

If you watched any marvel movie you know you don’t need to watch Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. or Agent Carter.

While if you watch Multiverse of Madness you need to watch Wandavision or else you don’t have an idea what the Dark Hold is or who her kids are. 

Perfect example, The Marvels is a direct sequel to Ms. Marvel. If you don’t watch Ms. Marvel you are completely lost. I could go on about how Thor 4 and Black Panther 2 really breaking your point but I am over this.

This is going to be the only sequel in the entire Multiverse Saga.,"I don't think he's saying that just because it's different it's bad.  

However, he is pointing out differences, and ALSO characterizing those differences as 'bad'. Whereas I personally enjoy those differences--

(For example, he's basically describing the entries of this saga as basically being 'too broad', 'unfocused', 'absolutely rushed' and 'with no proper buildup', and characterizing all of that in a negative way (eg. 'total and utter failure of planning' , 'such an indictment')).

And my response is to say that I view the same entries of this saga, not as being 'too broad', just 'broader' .  Not as being 'unfocused' just 'less narrowly focused'.  Not as being 'rushed' just as being 'quicker'. Not as lacking 'proper buildup', just as 'building up in a different way than last time'.  To me these are not negative qualities-- they are simply ways that this saga has been different than what came before, and I've personally enjoyed the broader scope, wider focus, and quicker buildup, etc.

That's all!  Different strokes for different folks.  If this saga had followed the same basic blueprint as the Infinity saga, I think for me it would have had diminishing returns and I would have enjoyed it less than I have.",Reddit
This is going to be the only sequel in the entire Multiverse Saga.,"I see your point.  I think many people agree with you.

I have a different perspective, however-- I think a broader focus leading up to the climactic movies of the saga doesn't necessarily mean those climactic movies will be worse.  I really enjoy the wider scope that the MCU now encompasses.  It's fun to have so many characters introduced that seem like they could populate multiple lineups of future teams like Thunderbolts / Midnight Suns / Young Avengers ... and then to speculate on how / when / where they might come together.

That's not a feeling we really had in the Infinity Saga (other than just with the one team, the Avengers).

I really enjoyed the first Guardians movie, and each member of the team only had a brief introduction, but it was good enough for that individual story, and for that team lineup to work.  With this saga, it's like we've been getting introduced to so many characters with the kind of brief 'good enough' introductions as we saw with say Drax, Rocket or Groot in Guardians 1... and then it's left to future installments to further develop them / mix and match them in fun ways.

Many of the many new character introductions in this saga have been QUITE successful, IMO (Shang-Chi, Yelena, Kate Bishop, Ms. Marvel, etc., were all really appealing even after only their first appearance that I've been eager to see them again).

In my lifetime, I've seen a tremendous number of movies where the entirety of the story was told within the runtime of a single standalone movie-- where the film introduced a rich backstory, multiple characters, an antagonist, and then proceeded to show character development, multiple interactions between characters between a web of relationships, plot twists and turns, and then an emotionally satisfying resolution by the end of the film.

Luke blowing up the Death Star at the end of the first Star Wars was an exceptional moment.  Darth Vader was a fantastically-established villain (in only like 15 minutes of screen-time in that first movie) and went on to become perhaps the most famous villain in pop culture for a few decades.

That movie didn't need a bunch of previous movies to establish context or momentum.  Luke Skywalker or Darth Vader didn't need to have made multiple prior appearances or interact with each other multiple times beforehand in order for that movie to tell a great story, and to tell it thrillingly.

Maybe Doomsday will suck, maybe it'll be regarded as better than Infinity War.  Who knows!?!  But from tons of experience I believe it's possible for a film to succeed wildly, based on what it does within its own runtime.",Reddit

How the Multiverse Saga could end: looking back & ahead,"Cool. But you forgot one thing. Everyone knows who Spiderman is, just not Peter Parker. But I still think ur idea stands, that he will not be in doomsday and have his own movie before appearing in secret wars.


The whole Kang subplot is so crazy to me since the timeline of it is not linear. Were there 2 multiverse wars? One before the creation of the sacred timeline and one after that led to Kang being banished? ""When"" did the multiverse war happen?


Also is there still a ""sacred timeline?"" If so, is it just 616? (Ours?). 


Will Kang tie in to doomsday somehow? Or was it concluded that they have gotten rid of them in Loki season 2",Reddit
How the Multiverse Saga could end: looking back & ahead,"I’m gonna be a big downer if your excited for the multiverse saga don’t read this:


Man… I really tried to hold on. I wanted to believe the MCU had a plan, that all these projects would build up to something incredible like Infinity War and Endgame did. But at this point? Yeah, the Multiverse Saga is cooked. Completely overcooked, dried out, and left in the oven too long.

The biggest problem? There’s no real direction. The Infinity Saga had a clear buildup every movie contributed to the overarching story, leading to Thanos. But now? We’ve had so many projects, and instead of building up momentum, everything just feels disconnected.

Let’s be real the multiverse should be the most exciting thing ever. It opens the door for insane possibilities, but instead, it’s been wasted on lazy writing, cameos, and nothing actually mattering. Like, what’s the end goal here? We had Kang introduced in Quantumania, and now he’s replaced cause with allegations stuff and everything.The Loki finale basically reset everything. Secret Wars is coming, but I don’t even know what I’m supposed to be hyped for anymore.

And now we’re supposed to trust Avengers: Doomsday to bring it all together? Nah. I have zero faith. The roster isn’t even clear, and brings the Fox X men instead of building a relationship with a new version and the audience. Hot take honestly just make a live action version of the 97 x men join avengers? Would that be lazy? Probably? But that version of the x men is in its prime and well established.

The  stakes feel nonexistent, and it doesn’t feel like we’re heading toward anything meaningful. Even the Avengers name doesn’t hit the same anymore because, honestly, who even are the Avengers at this point? Half the original team is gone, and the new generation doesn’t feel established enough to carry the weight of a massive event film.

At this point, I just want the MCU to slow down, focus on telling good stories, and actually build anticipation again. Right now, it just feels like they’re throwing stuff at the wall and hoping something sticks. And I can’t pretend to be excited for Doomsday when I don’t even know if Marvel itself knows what it’s doing anymore.

Ngl I’m more interested in what steer level stuff is happening on Daredevil from the stuff I heard.

I love the environment for the new Fantastic 4 world and loved that they are on their own bubble and well established and developed there.",Reddit
How the Multiverse Saga could end: looking back & ahead,TLDR ,Reddit
How the Multiverse Saga could end: looking back & ahead,"Ah yeah you're right about Spider-Man

No I thought there was only one Multiversal War. It is indeed not-linear, as Kang from Quantumania was from the 31st century.  But they all learned about the Multiverse at the same ""moment"", and Kang the Conqueror thought they were destroying the Multiverse, and therefore started a war to keep this from happening. He Who Remains stopped the war with the creation of the Sacred Timeline (and Alioth) / TVA.

So the Multiversal War was before He Who Remains created the TVA.

And no, the Sacred Timeline was destroyed, so 616 (and some other realities) are now totally ""uncovered"" in the Multiverse

I think Kang will not tie in. The ""new"" TVA at the end of Loki season 2 made sure that they will get rid of all evil Kangs.",Reddit
How the Multiverse Saga could end: looking back & ahead,"I think people are putting too much on the cast of Doomsday.


The Fantastic Four, X-Men and Thunderbolts will only make small appearances. After all, this movie has to set up a brand new Avengers team.


I think Doom will have been exiled from or escaped his own universe, where he was about to be stopped by the FF. Then he becomes the ruler of Latvaria, but starts doing dodgy stuff, which leads to a small recon mission by the Thunderbolts. This reveals his identity as ""Tony Stark"".


This will set in motion the creation of the New Avengers (Captain America, Falcon, Ant Man, Thor, Shang Chi, Black Panther).


The end of the movie will set up Secret Wars, and will have the aforementioned cameos.",Reddit

Why I don’t think these non-announced cast members that I don’t think will be in Doomsday,Title gave an aneurism,Reddit
Why I don’t think these non-announced cast members that I don’t think will be in Doomsday,"A few things:  

* GotG 3 takes place in early 2026.  It is currently early 2027 as of BNW and Born Again, and will likely be late 2027 or early 2028 by the time of the events of Doomsday.  So Quill being busy with his grandfather is a little silly.  He's had close to two years on Earth with him and I imagine he's getting a bit bored in Missouri since spending most of his life as a space adventurer.  
* Clearly there is intent for Deadpool and Wolverine (and maybe Laura, maybe some of Deadpool's other supporting cast like Colossus, NTW & Yukio, etc) to reach the MCU proper *eventually.*  We can say that maybe Deadpool's tone is wrong for Doomsday, but when is it going to be right?  I doubt Secret Wars is going to have a light, humorous tone either.  
* At least one of Wanda's kids already exists in 616.  I don't particularly think Billy will show up before his story is continued and he's reunited with Tommy (presumably in VisionQuest), but he's definitely already on the timeline.  
* Not sure where you're getting that Armor Wars will release between Doomsday and Secret Wars.  There hasn't been any official news on the project in almost three years since it was announced to be a movie instead of a series.  *Maybe* it'll be between the two, but maybe that slot will be one of several other options.  
* Wong definitely *isn't* wherever Strange is.  Last seen, Strange was heading into the Dark Dimension with Clea.  Wong's appearances in She-Hulk happen after that.  So unless they do all of Strange's story about Clea and the incursion off-screen and have him return to Earth, those two are quite separated at the moment and Wong could reasonably appear.  Seeing as Wong is the Sorcerer Supreme tasked with defending Earth, it in fact seems incredibly likely that he will appear.  
* Whether street-level heroes like Daredevil show up is, I think, much more a matter of individual character popularity than it is power level.  The fact that Matt has limited ability to fight Doctor Doom isn't as big a deal as the fact that he's incredibly popular and people would love to see him included.  Doomsday happens after season 2 of Born Again is scheduled to come out, so we're really not going to know if Daredevil's story is in a place to be present in Doomsday until that's concluded.",Reddit

How? If Logan happened, and the x-men were dead when that was going on. So it’s either the timeline from days of future past or it’s an entirely different universe. 

“Deadpool is to silly” 
Bro what 😭 I get that he makes jokes, but he’s literally the only character to have gotten a rated r film in the MCU, probably will be the only one for a while, and can carry a franchise, plus him being in doomsday is $$

“Scarlet witch died in mom” 
Ummm no… it’s clear the writers teased her still being alive in the end when she sacrificed herself.

Why I don’t think these non-announced cast members that I don’t think will be in Doomsday,"Some thoughts...


1.  The only thing that matters is ""Can this character make money?"".  The MCU isnt comics where they lose $5,000 if they make a mistake, The Marvels cost them 300 million.  So when you're talking about who will be included, the first and only question is ""Can this character make money?""


2.  Armor Wars is cancelled.  Because the answer to that question was ""no"".


3.  There is no concept of ""street level heroes"" in the MCU.  That's a social media concept.  In the MCU, a character appears if their appearance either makes more money or opens a door to make more money.


4.  All of those universe numbers you posted?  Not a single person in the general audience has any idea what any of that means, and they are going to check right out if its necessary to figure that out just to watch a movie.  Wolverine is alive in a universe if it means the movie will make more money, he's dead if it means the movie will make more money.",Reddit
Why I don’t think these non-announced cast members that I don’t think will be in Doomsday,"Oops. At first I wanted to write the post a little different but when it turned out like it did, I changed some of it but apparently forgot about the ""that I don’t think""",Reddit
Why I don’t think these non-announced cast members that I don’t think will be in Doomsday,"Okay those are all good points. 

-concerning Deadpool: I think Marvel will just throw every character they have in Secret Wars just for the purpose of them being in it and I can imagine Deadpool being serious enough for most of Secret Wars and then getting all meta when the movie comes near the end. It’s just Doomsday that I imagine will have too many terrible things happen for Deadpool to fit in

-I didn’t know / remember that about Wandas Kids

-[According to IMDb](https://m.imdb.com/list/ls500354651/) Armor Wars will come out in late 2026, Secret Wars in May 2027",Reddit
Why I don’t think these non-announced cast members that I don’t think will be in Doomsday,"We saw Wolverine die. Bringing this Wolverine back would be like erasing his death. We don’t have that problem with the X-men. Apart from the fact that my main reason against Deadpool was something else, I meant that he’s too silly in a meta way and that he’s got R-rated movies has nothing to with other. Also I said „IF Scarlet Witch is dead""",Reddit
Why I don’t think these non-announced cast members that I don’t think will be in Doomsday,"I agree with all except the last one. 

I feel like over the years, especially since the beggining of the multiverse saga, people have grown and learned to differentiate universes. For example Pattionsons Batman is elseworld. The audience may not know the numbers but they will def be able to tell in between each one liken “The Fox Universe”, “The Sony Verse” etc",Reddit
Why I don’t think these non-announced cast members that I don’t think will be in Doomsday,"One thing that makes me think perhaps we will see Deadpool and Wolverine (and, again, quite possibly Colossus and X-23) in Doomsday is that so much of the casting feels like a set up for an X-Men vs Avengers theme, but with the X-Men severely understaffed.  From the Doomsday announcement we've got 19 of Earth's most powerful heroes and seven X-Men characters.  That feels pretty unbalanced.  So maybe Wade, Logan, etc will join to shore up that side.  

Billy Maximoff is one of the main characters of Agatha All Along, that's where all the advancement of that story is coming from.  

IMDb is user-generated.  If there were actual news of Armor Wars, it'd have been reported on and talked about endlessly as every official Marvel release has been.  As said, there hasn't been any official word since 2022.  Considering the utter lack of excitement for the project, it wouldn't surprise me if something else takes the place of happening between Doomsday and Secret Wars.",Reddit
Why I don’t think these non-announced cast members that I don’t think will be in Doomsday,"We also heard that the x-men also died.. Charles killed them.. which is why I say, this xmen team will either be from the timeline and date in which Wolverine saved after the events of days of future past, or a complete and different universe that’s alike to the fox. So if its fox, it’s gonna be tricky since their will be 2 wolverines, if its another universe, then the Logan we saw in Deadpool 3 will most likely join them.


As for Deadpool, it’s been long overdue for him to get some screen time alongside other MCU characters, so I’m sure he’ll appear, wether it’s in a small role or cameo, I don’t see why marvel wouldn’t include him & 

as for Wanda it’s just pretty clear she ain’t dead",Reddit
Why I don’t think these non-announced cast members that I don’t think will be in Doomsday,"Okay fine maybe there’s no canon reason for Wolverine not to be in the movie but it would still feel wrong / weird to me if Hugh Jackmans Wolverine showed up alongside the other X-men. I just looked up in which universe Deadpool and Wolverine ended up in and apparently it’s 10005. I thought it was a completely different one but since we seem to agree that the rest of the X-men will only be from a similar universe, then that still means the both of them are in a different universe than the rest of the characters. 

I never said Deadpool can’t show up in another movie or show. She-Hulk would be perfect but I could also see him in Wonder-Man, Spider-Man or even Armor Wars. Just not in Doomsday.

And you still haven’t explained why you disagree with my theories about Deadpool not being in Doomsday because he’s from a fourth universe and Wanda not being in it because it wouldn’t be good for her character right nowadays",Reddit
Why I don’t think these non-announced cast members that I don’t think will be in Doomsday,"So what ur saying is, it would make more sense for Deadpool… who just came off a billion dollar multiverse movie… to appear in solo projects like she hulk (which was horrible), wonder man? What? I could see maybe spider man but even then.. it’s just common sense to have Deadpool appear in doomsday, maybe even doctor strange 3, I do think him and Hugh’s Wolverine will play a part in terms of forming a multiversal resistance.  


And I mean to you it may be weird to see Hugh Jackman alongside his xmen again, but to alot of us it won’t , since we never got to see them in their actual comic representations, and also, if Wolverine and Deadpool did indeed go back to earth 10005 after the events of Deadpool 3 like you said, then it’s pretty much confirmed that the x-men that we will see in doomsday will be from another universe we haven’t seen. And whether or not they have their own version of Wolverine will be determined. 

As for Wanda, how will it not fit her character? She caused a hex in a town and mind controlled people, then went on a killing rampage to kill the Illuminati. The best case scenario would be for Doom to manipulate her somehow into getting her to either give up her powers or help doom stop the incursions by shaping reality around them and reedming herself",Reddit
Why I don’t think these non-announced cast members that I don’t think will be in Doomsday,"Also bro, my bad I forgot to mention about how you said it would be weird to see Hugh with the xmen again. 

I get you, but I’m assuming, the xmen that we see in doomsday, won’t have a Wolverine, and well the Wolverine that we saw in Deadpool 3 lost his Xmen, so I think that’ll just be a perfect scenario to have them both come together!",Reddit

What’s your leading theory on what the stories of these two films will be?,">!What I think could happen is:!<

1. >!Doom (who looks like Tony from MCU616) will try to manipulate the Avengers that Monica is in danger and X-Men are a threat to the universe!<
2. >!They'd believe someone who looks likes the man that sacrificed his life for the universe and was their was friend and teammate!<
3. >!Avengers will go up against X-Men to bring back Rambeau and save the universe from X-Men while X-Men might see Avengers as a threat (due to incursion and a variant of Dr. Strange did do some bad stuff)!<
4. >!Doom will capture and make them battle each other in his battleworld with most of their memories wiped except that each of them sees each other as a threat!<

>!This would be what Doomsday will comprised of, then similar to how Antman was the saving grace in Endgame after Infinity War, I think Spider-Man will become the saving grace, fingers crossed that he might get some other 'super heroes' to help, maybe ones who helped him with other multiversal shenningans \*wink wink\*!<

>!This would start the Secret Wars, now we'd have Avengers, X-Men, Fantastic Four, Thunderbolts, Young Avengers, Spider-Society (possibly), Midnight Suns (possibly) and other heroes, who'd go off against Doom after getting their memory back, MAN, the audience will shower themselves with their own pleasure!<

What old movies do I need to watch to understand avengers doomsday,"The first two X-Men movies (X-Men and X2: X-Men United) are all you need to be introduced to all of the people who have been announced so far, but their stories do continue in X-Men: The Last Stand, The Wolverine, and X-Men: Days of Future Past. (Of course Days of Future Past *also* continues the story of the characters from X-Men: First Class.)

And if you've seen Deadpool 2 and/or Deadpool & Wolverine, you'll know that the plot of Logan leads into those.

But it's possible that there will be cameos or plotlines continued from other movies in the X-Men franchise. We just don't know yet.

That said, you shouldn't have to watch any of the old movies to just understand Doomsday. You'll just miss out on the significance of some of the cameos and references.",Reddit

Why Doomsday?,"Cause its Doom's movie, they've said they are looking at Doom as the main character much like they did with Thanos, so Avengers vs X-Men doesn't scream as a movie about Doom",Reddit
Why Doomsday?,Avengers vs X-Men probably isn’t even gonna be the main driving point of the film. The teams will probably fight for a bit and have their differences. They’ll probably throw slight jabs at each other but they most likely won’t fight for the entire runtime.,Reddit
Why Doomsday?,"Just because the Avengers and X-Men are in a movie, doesn’t mean it’ll be Avengers vs X-Men",Reddit
Why Doomsday?,"If Avengers vs X-Men is a thing that happens in this movie, it will be a sub-plot not unlike what they did with Planet Hulk in Thor 3.",Reddit
Why Doomsday?,Because the X-Men will probably be dead before they meet the Avengers.,Reddit
Why Doomsday?,Cuz they’ll fight each other in Act 2 and realize the real enemy is Doctor Doom and team up to fight him.,Reddit
Why Doomsday?,"> Wouldn't avengers VS X-Men be a way cooler name? 

Because that's not the story they're telling. Doomsday is the lead-in to Secret Wars, which is heavily based on the 2017 comic of the same name.

Not only do the concept art for the movie scream ""Doom's Battleworld,"" but multiple movies have directly stated or warned that the Incursions event is coming and that, in the comics leads to Doom's reshaping the multiverse into Battleworld.

At most, the Avengers & X-Men may get into a brief fight before realizing that they're ultimately allies against the same threat (likely because their worlds are about to collide), but it would make about as much sense to name this movie ""Avengers Vs X-Men"" as naming Infinity War ""Avengers Vs Guardians of the Galaxy"" just because [this fight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQoNILVFFvs) happened.",Reddit
Why Doomsday?,"It sounds cool, but they will ultimately end up on the same team",Reddit

Avengers Doomsday more Casting announcement,They definitely are hiding a lot of actors. Like at the very least Cumberbatch is definitely going to be in there,Reddit
Avengers Doomsday more Casting announcement,"I think they omitted too many characters to not have another cast announcement. Spider-Man, Strange, the Hulks, Guardians, Deadpool, Wolverine, etc. wild if an Avengers movie omitted all those characters.",Reddit

Avengers Doomsday more Casting announcement,"Perhaps reveal them in a teaser trailer in about a year exactly after the casting announcement days ago or once post-production for the movie is finished?, but either way I'm sure they're keeping a big surprise like how Reed and Black bolt weren't shown in MOM trailers or Tobey and Andrew in NWH",Reddit

How will Avengers: Doomsday be set up? (SPOILERS),"Sam deciding to restart the Avengers is actually a good thing to get out of the way even though it doesn't feel like it. Thunderbolts will establish that group's dynamics and I think Sam will show up at the end and ask them to join the New Avengers for a new threat that's coming or whatever. F4 will also set up those characters and there is evidence that there will be some set-up for Doom in that movie. Incursions have already been explained in MOM, Monica being in the pseudo-Fox universe is triggering an Incursion with MCU earth and the returning X-Men are almost definitely from that universe, Loki and the TVA have been explored, the latter has already been introduced to the general audience through DP and W, all Doomsday would have to do is somehow explain Loki being where he is, which could be done in like 1 minute.",Reddit
How will Avengers: Doomsday be set up? (SPOILERS),"I've spent a couple of boring shifts in work thinking about this.

Thunderbolts - Film ends with the Thunderbolts working for the government, based out of Stark Tower in NYC.

F4 - The Reed/Doom rivalry is introduced in the back half of the movie. They're both trying to develop multiversal travel. Film ends with Reed cracking the code on multiversal travel and the F4 jumping to present day 616 NYC, where they are detained by the Thunderbolts. Doom cracks multiversal travel in a post-credit scene.

Doomsday - Film opens with a recast He Who Remains defeating the final Kang variant, but is fatally wounded in the process, leading to a break in the endless cycle that created the sacred timeline. HWR will jump to the F4 dimension and will hand over the reigns of saving the multiverse to Doom. Doom will jump to 616 NYC to abduct Reed, so he can keep him around to watch Doom saving the multiverse. He'll attack Stark Tower, defeating (but not killing) the Thunderbolts, and will escape with Reed. Valentina will refuse to let the Thunderbolts pursue, selfishly keeping them back as her personal bodyguard incase Doom returns. Bucky and Yelena will go rogue and sneak away to join up with the Avengers team Sam has been building in secret, so they can go after Doom. 

No idea where it can go after that. Assuming it might be a race to beat to beat Doom to Loki.",Reddit
How will Avengers: Doomsday be set up? (SPOILERS),Definitely teased like Thanos in F4 and Thunderbolts might tease something too.,Reddit

How will Avengers: Doomsday be set up? (SPOILERS),"Y’all thinking Sam will ask the thunderbolts to join the avengers is absurd, that movies gonna establish them as their own team. Based on the casting, the avengers will be Cap, Falcon, Thor, Panther, Ant-Man, and Shang-Chi. They’ll assemble in Doomsday so no the next two movies will not set this up. If Cap’s movie couldn’t do it then they’re def saving it for Doomsday",Reddit
How will Avengers: Doomsday be set up? (SPOILERS),I am kind of just expecting it to be Loki popping into a bunch of universes pulling heroes together to stop Doom who is trying to destroy them.,Reddit
How will Avengers: Doomsday be set up? (SPOILERS),"I think Fantastic Four will be the biggest setup.  I was assuming Doctor Strange 3 would come and do a lot of heavy lifting with incursions and kick-starting the story, but now it seems F4 will. Not sure how, but part of me thinks since we've already seen a Reed lead an Illuminati team to learn about the multiverse, maybe that is how, or maybe their universe is destroyed by an incursion by the end of the movie and they have to explore the multiverse for a new home.

I doubt Thunderbolts or F4, will necessarily join the Avengers, just be doing their own thing and have to team up with the Avengers (think Guardians in IW).",Reddit
How will Avengers: Doomsday be set up? (SPOILERS),I think Doom might be teased in the F4 stinger.,Reddit
How will Avengers: Doomsday be set up? (SPOILERS),"my money is on doctor strange bringing it all together at the beginning of doomsday. fantastic four will probably do some time travel stuff to get here and only half the casts will be focused on in doomsday is my guess.

the other half will be in secret wars. just like what they did for infinite war/endgame",Reddit
How will Avengers: Doomsday be set up? (SPOILERS),[deleted],Reddit
How will Avengers: Doomsday be set up? (SPOILERS),"*First Steps*: Quick origin story on the family, Reed/Victor feud. 


Then the big mission that will mirror the Challenger disaster - except they end up surviving and getting their powers. Surfer witnesses this disaster and notifies Galactus he found a planet to consume.

Reed is unaware of his powers, or can’t access them yet. He’s left out in a way, but he has his intellect to help them. It will be them vs. Galactus/Surfer in this movie. 

Maybe during the final fight, some sort of wormhole/tear in the multiverse occurs. They are just about to be defeated when Reed’s power is discovered, and he reaches through the hole to bring them to the 616 timeline. They escape from Galactus and Surfer just in the nick of time.

End credits Victor/Doom scene.

*Doomsday:* Further back story in Victor/Doom. Goes on a rampage killing the Kangs and tearing open all the universes.",Reddit
How will Avengers: Doomsday be set up? (SPOILERS),"I think the Brave New World post credit scene and Sam hinting at rebuilding the Avengers can absolutely be considered set up for Doomsday. The fact that both the Thunderbolts and Fantastic Four casts will appear makes me confident that both of those movies will also be setting up Doomsday, definitely in their post credit scenes but maybe also within the actual movie. I can see the lack of an Avengers team being a focus in Thunderbolts coming into play to set up Doomsday and as for Fantastic Four you have both the Multiversal element and Doom being a FF villain.

Also, who's to say there hasn't already been set up for Doomsday. I can see The Marvels, Multiverse Of Madness, Shang-Chi, and Quantumania post credit scenes all being pretty crucial. There's also the entirety of Loki and D&W, which will both almost certainly be important too",Reddit
How will Avengers: Doomsday be set up? (SPOILERS),ROM spaceknight saves us all,Reddit
How will Avengers: Doomsday be set up? (SPOILERS),"Cap 4 to me is obvious set up for the Thunderbolts becoming the new Avengers team.  The government wants a new Avengers and they’re gonna get it.  The asterisk is gonna be because the end of the movie reveals them as the Dark Avengers, and thats why theyre announced to the in Doomsday already.

Doom will probably show up in the Fantastic Four post credits.

Plus you’re forgetting set up from other movies.  We know Namor, Shuri and MBaku are in it so Wakanda Forever is clear set up.  Marvels too for the X Men universe.  Multiverse of Madness set up incursions which will surely come into play.  Loki is obviously gonna be important.  It’s already all set up I don’t know what else we need.",Reddit
How will Avengers: Doomsday be set up? (SPOILERS),"Doom himself hasn't been setup yet, but Multiverse of Madness, Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania, and Captain America Brave New World all do have subtle setup for the events leading into it & Secret Wars - they all directly mention or warn of the upcoming Incursions event that directly leads to the 2017 Secret Wars storyline.

Doom himself is likely to be teased in FF or show up directly in the post-credits scene.",Reddit

How will Avengers: Doomsday be set up? (SPOILERS),"I hope that Kang isn't just treated like the Asgardian ship in IW.  I hope he's more akin to Thanos tracking down the remaining Infinity Stones and Doom has to jump to different realities to track down powerful Kang's to steal their knowledge/technology/power to build his own multiversal power or something like that.

I'm trying to think of a equivalent. Maybe Thanos in Guardians of the Galaxy? Only a few minutes of screen time but enough to establish a relationship there between him and Reed.

Have Reed reluctantly call him prior to the 3rd act showdown with Galactus. He only appears on the screen and he's in full armour. In the post credit scene he'll solve mulriversal travel, and only then remove his armour to reveal RDJ. Would be a cool surprise for the 2 people that aren't aware of the casting.",Reddit

Avengers: Doomsday cast revealed in this quick 30-minute video! (with images),They already uploaded a few second version. Not really necessary,Reddit
Avengers: Doomsday cast revealed in this quick 30-minute video! (with images),"It's an amazing cast and I'm stoked, especially Thor who I was hoping for but wasn't sure Hemsworth would do it and I'm extra stoked that Loki will be a part of it, I was not expecting that but was definitely hoping for it! Namor is cool/unexpected too. I definitely wasn't expecting the old X-Men cast, that was an awesome surprise! And with Channing Tatum's Gambit!? Fuck yes!! But I think the best part of the reveal was the complete lack of ""young Avengers"" characters, I really can't stand any of them, especially with all the focus that's been put on them post-endgame, not a lot but still too much imo.

No captain Marvel is an odd choice, or her sidekick who got trapped in the X-Men universe. Especially since the end of the Marvel's was the only post-endgame movies to seemingly set up doomsday so far. Though I haven't seen BNW yet. The Marvel's was a terrible movie but I still love Captain Marvel as a character and her first movie was great, but I'm heavily biased due to all the grunge!

My only disappointment, and it's a pretty big one for me, is the complete lack of my all-time favs: spider-man, Deadpool, Silver Surfer, wolverine and Daredevil. Wolverine is a strange omission considering it's basically half (or I guess 1/3) an X-Men movie, but I'm assuming/hoping him and everyone else I just listed will be in secret wars - like how the missing characters in IW were in EG. Also I'm surprised Doctor Strange isn't part of this considering A)he's awesome AF, and B) the multiverse and incursions are his speciality. DS2 was one of the most important setups for doomsday other than Loki, how can they not include him in both movies? Or at least a small part of doomsday. And yeah Daredevil doesn't really belong in this type of story, but dammit they finally brought him into the MCU, I want/need more live action daredevil in my life! I've been dreaming of Daredevil being in a proper MCU ensemble movie since the Netflix series started and I know I'm not the only one! 

I also really want/need more live action silver surfer, especially if she's finally done right in FF. I was disappointed they made her female at first, but after thinking about it more, I much prefer watching a hot silvery, curvy female surfer vs another muscly male! SS will always be Norrin Radd to me. I'm surprised SS wasn't announced as well, I really hope that doesn't mean she dies or something during FF and they're just using SS for one movie alone! That character is too special to waste on just one story.

And ever since they announced RDJ as doom they essentially obligated themselves to have spider-man be a part of doomsday considering the brilliant relationship they developed between TS/PP. I still tear up every time I re-watch IW! ""I don't wanna go."" 😢

Overall I couldn't be more psyched but also a little disappointed. But I'm willing to bet they'll make it up to me when secret wars eventually comes out.

Avengers Doomsday Composer,"I probably more keen towards newton brothers since they certainly love to respect previous score or leit motif which MCU kind of lack, so there is a chance they will use the usual avengers theme but added their own flair in it without changing much.

Spiderman 4 could be a mess but there is one way to save it.,"I feel like it will be fully multiversal but not as big to the overaching story. My theory based on the cast announcement for doomsday is that the ""champions"" or ""young avengers"" will come together in Spider-Man 4. 


Kate Bishop, Wiccan, Stature, America Chavez, Kid Loki, Ms. Marvel, Riri Williams all could make an appearance (I don't think all will, just 4-5 of them). Then add in Jean Grey and that's a fun team full of interactions for a movie about surviving ""New York Battleworld.""


This does push a grounded story to SM5 but it also progresses Peter as he now has to be a leader to this group being the only one that was an Avenger and was involved in the Thanos fights. It flips the script from IW/E.


Not sure about this at all, just found the lack of young avengers noticable in the cast announcement.",Reddit

We could just see Slim and Red, and AoA Jean and Logan, in some minor setpiece. 

Again, this is assuming these people would do it for almost nothing like me, and costume changes work in. Seems like they may enjoy the nostalgia of old coworkers.

Doomsday & Secret Wars won't be Avengers movies: Events don't need franchise names.,"A lot of people saying they have to because it puts butts in seats, branding, and yeah I get that but it’s literally Marvel Studios. I remember how crazy and unrelenting the marketing for IW was and even then I would say, even if they just called it “Infinity War” or “Infinity Gauntlet”. It would have done the same.  Also the big studio can make a small risk such as that. I think Doomsday alone would make for a cooler title if they put Doctor Doom at the forefront of the marketing and there you go. He’s arguably the most iconic Marvel Villain of all time. I think that would be cool and intriguing to comic readers and general audience alike. A lot of the GA figure they know what to expect now when a move says Avengers in front of it. With that said the Avengers wasn’t always THE premiere brand either. They out in the work to get it there and they could also do that with other titles besides just the Avengers. Like it is a little wild that the F4 and the X-me, two teams that are historically more foundational to Marvels overall success and place in pop culture are non title character in a Avengers branded crossover event with all three teams in it.

Doomsday & Secret Wars won't be Avengers movies: Events don't need franchise names.,"Marketing is a lot more than just the name. Something called “Marvels Doomsday” with Doctor Doom splattered all over the posters and RDJ’s names attached would still sell tickets. I get what you’re saying but damn it would be a bold and intriguing statement as far as their movie titles go. Bc imo this seems to be more than just an Avengers movie. Yeah IW and Endgame had more character but the Avengers team were still at the center narratively other than Thanos. Maybe I’m wrong but I get the vibe this one is much more as far as the casting goes. 

And I know movie and comics are completely different ball parks but not even the comics have to put the Avengers title in front of all their big events to sell… and that industry will do anything to make some money most of the time.  Their cash flow is a lot less in comparison. 

I’m not saying they needed to do that but I don’t think it would have been a stupid idea from a marketing standpoint especially if done properly. However I do think the Avengers shouldn’t just be secluded to being the crossover event title and they shouldn’t be the only with the F4 and X-men on the way.

How to prepare for Avengers Doomsday?,Release Order. And they've confirmed a bunch of the old X-Men Cast so I'd suggest watching the X-Men films in release order as well. I'd probably wait on the defenders saga until they confirm if they'll be part of Doomsday plus that would basically double your watch time already,Reddit

How to prepare for Avengers Doomsday?,"I started watching movie by movie like all Captain America's, all Thors.. but then decided to do timeline order and to me it made more sense.

How to prepare for Avengers Doomsday?,I wouldn’t bother trying to catch up.  I’m positive it’ll make sense if you’ve completely tuned out during this saga.  Most casual audiences have.,Reddit
How to prepare for Avengers Doomsday?,"Watch in release order.

I would watch some, but not all of the X-Men films. The original X-Men trilogy, First Class, and Days of Future Past should be enough.

The Defenders Saga doesn't currently seem necessary but half the shows are worth watching (Daredevil, Jessica Jones, and Luke Cage) while the other half are okay if you're interested.",Reddit
How to prepare for Avengers Doomsday?,"I mean, you should definetely familiarize yourself with the Fox X-MEN characters. Theres going to be a lot of millenial and Gen X fans that will be rooting for them over the Avengers because honestly X-MEN was the Avengers for people who grew up in the 80s and 90s.

You don't have to worry too much about the Fantastic 4 because their movie drops later this year, but they are another group who were popular but more so back in the 50's,60s and 70s.",Reddit
How to prepare for Avengers Doomsday?,"Release order is the way to go. Wandavision, Loki season 1 and 2 should get you ready. ",Reddit
How to prepare for Avengers Doomsday?,"Going by the characters that are confirmed to be in the movie, here’s what I’ll suggest, as well as which characters are in that project: 

Falcon & The Winter Soldier (Sam, Bucky, US Agent, Joaquin)

Shang Chi 

Black Widow (Yelena, Red Guardian)

Loki series

Black Panther Wakanda Forever (Shuri, M’Baku, Namor)

Thunderbolts* (Yelena, Bucky, Red Guardian, US Agent, Ghost)

Fantastic Four First Steps

.

And these projects I’m assuming will be relevant as well, but the characters from them haven’t been confirmed for Doomsday yet:

Wandavision

No Way Home 

Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness",Reddit
How to prepare for Avengers Doomsday?,If you’re getting ready just for doomsday specifically then just watch all the multiversal films plus Loki season 1 and 2 and maybe WandaVison,Reddit

The X-men films are a very mixed bag, I also can’t imagine anything actually from them will impact this film, it’s probably not even the same universe. As long as you know who the characters are you’ll likely be fine.

That said, X Men, X2, First Class, Days of Future Past and Logan are all pretty good. You’ll provably want to watch the Deadpool films but be warned the humour is pretty marmite.",Reddit

Once the kid wants to/needs to run around, public showings were out for me until they could reasonably sit through a film.

Also, I think we do kinda have to mention that times have changed immensely. Gérard Depardieu, an absolutely disgusting admitted rapist, had a career in Hollywood with many acclaimed directors up to 2017. In 1991, his publicist waved the accusations off by saying ""he's sorry, but it happened"". It was treated like it was a normal thing.

We live in a time where people are just itching to complain about how their favorite IP didn't make their movie or show the way they envisioned it. Whether it's Marvel, DC, Star Wars or even pro wrestling and ESPN/sports programming. And to make matters worse, there are grifters and other paid agitators who do this for money. I get it, people have high expectations (FFS, Infinity War/Endgame probably will never be topped), so they want to get their money's worth at the theater or on their big screen at home. Not to mention we have talking heads on cable news and sports networks shouting at each other or at the camera, politicians with no filter, and this stuff either is a reflection of real life or vice-versa. It sucks, but I just prefer to let my favorite movies/shows/sports entertain me. If they don't, I move on and don't whine about it. 

With all that said, I'm with you. I actually saw D&W twice in the theater, GOTG3 is one of my all time faves, Loki was awesome, and Agatha was entertaining. Born Again has been great so far, even though I miss a lot of the OG characters. I think Thunderbolts\* will kick ass. I love Bucky, Yelena, and Guardian, and I look forward to seeing what Walker and the rest of Valentina's crew have in store for us.

fact of the matter is nobody knew what infinity war and endgame were going to be until they broke the story developing those movies. they took what happened before and made a narrative to fit, the lead up movies weren’t setting up a story that wasn’t defined yet. 

they’ll take the disparate parts from these movies like they did with phase 1-3 and try and come up with a coherent story incorporating as much as they can and discard the rest

Age of Ultron had some fans a little mixed, and nor many paid attention to Ant Man.

Only reason Phase 3 was so universally applauded is because it was all coming together and near climax, but even then people were going full force to hate on Captain Marvel.

Let's not forget to mention the fact that Marvel could never win with fans who kept saying it's all so formulaic, but the second they went out to explore and take chances those same fans were screaming that it was too different.

Also I have enjoyed some of the stuff that's come out of the post endgame era like Black Widow, Shang chi, Eternals and Wakanda Forever. Perfect? No, but ticked a lot of the boxes for me and had good moments that I think made it stand ok it's own.

"If every time something new comes out that you liked or made you excited that “marvel is so back”, I think it’s fair to say that they’ve been back","> The general feedback was large box office takes. 

Did you actually look at the numbers?

Iron Man: $319m (Domestic) | $585m (Worldwide)

Hulk: $134m (D) | $264m (WW)

Iron Man 2: $312m (D) | $623m (WW)

Thor: $181m (D) | $449 (WW)

Captain America: $179m (D) | $370m (WW)

With the exception of Iron Man 2 (which was not popular as shown by the previous graph), none of them got even close to Iron Man 1's box office performance. Iron Man & Iron Man 2 were also the only ones pre-Avengers to break the top 10 highest grossing films of the year. The Smurfs movie outgrossed Thor & Captain America.

Meanwhile we have people talking about how CA:BNW isn't doing well because it only brought in $400m in 2 weeks. But that's still more than Hulk or CA1 brought in and only trailing behind the first Thor by about $48m.

Regardless, the box office numbers aren't the end-all-be-all of ""did people like the movies"" like you're implying. Thor 2 was widely considered the worst MCU movie ever made until recent years and it still grossed $644m worldwide.

> No one knew who the Avengers were, comics were a vanishingly small niche product by that point and the general audience had no idea that ""Avengers"" were even a thing.

It wasn't *who* the Avengers were that built hype, it was the fact that we were getting a live action, big budget superhero teamup movie for the first time ever & before Justice League no less (despite Batman & Superman being way more popular & profitable). That was a ""history's first"" thing and the original Iron Man set the bar for it incredibly high.",Reddit

As an example, M'Baku was in IW but he had a SINGLE line. I don't think Falcon will have a main role, same deal for characters like Ghost, Red Guardian, etc. Thanos also famously had no real character development before IW (Those 2 post credits scenes definitely do not count, as they contributed NOTHING to Thanos' actual appearance, and his short GotG cameo also did nothing for him) yet by making him the main character they were able to develop him well.

Edit: in infinity war, we had Thor opening up to Rocket, gamora opening up to Thanos and Peter, Wanda and Vision's relationship, Tony and Pepper's relationship, ideology between Tony and strange and other things.

"‘Avengers: Doomsday’ Stunt Clocks 275M Views, Marvel Livestream All-Time Record; “There’s Always Room For More” Cast Says Marvel","I know someone in a Discord server who's done nothing but spitewatch the MCU and call every movie bad ever since Disney bought Marvel because he thinks any movie that a big corp makes MUST be bad else it means supporting everything that corp does for some reason, and it used to be a minor nuisance but people on that server started listening to him after Endgame solely because it's more popular to hate on the MCU after Endgame.

The issue is he forcefully tries to make every movie bad and he starts having bizarre reasons to make the movie bad if the movie is considered good. He did not like the first two Spider-Man movies because he said it ""ruins the character of Spider-Man, as the MCU always does, they should just start over"" and then when No Way Home reset it it was ""They started over MCU Spider-Man, meaning they wasted all of our time in the trilogy, so it's bad. Also the only good parts were Tobey and Andrew, because they weren't made by Disney"". Deadpool and Wolverine was ""They ruined the character of Deadpool, and missed his entire point. They should've just made a new Deadpool movie and not put it in the MCU at all. In fact, if you think about it, people only liked it because it's a Fox movie, so really it's not an MCU movie, and maybe it's good.""

I mean respect for the hustle but forcing yourself to hate a movie you can't find much to hate about will result in rather weirder reasons to hate them. His favorite comic book team is the Fantastic Four and he's already pre-hating the MCU F4 right now, mostly because it too ""ruins the Fantastic Four's character"".",Reddit

Random snippets of him that I remember was hating Iron Man as a concept because he didn't like the idea of a billionaire actually trying to be a better person because if he liked Iron Man he'd have to accept the idea of the possibility of real life billionaires actually having the capacity to have empathy. Disliking Winter Soldier because ""It implies Captain America can stop corruption in the government"" because they messed up HYDRA's plans.

When it's about a very critically badly reviewed MCU movie he tends to parrot the actual criticisms of a movie but when he has to actually criticize a movie that most people consider are good he struggles to actually form opinions that like, make sense. There's plenty of ways to critique even the better MCU movies like Winter Soldier, but his critiques often boil down to ""it's bad, you should HATE it.""

Here's what I think Phase 6's film slate will be after the Avengers: Doomsday announcement,"I could definitely see them making Spider-Man 4 and Doctor Strange 3 basically add-ons to Doomsday and Secret Wars. It’s such a huge story to tell. People are complaining about them missing in the (unfinished) Doomsday cast reveal but they might have a huuuuge story in regards to Doom and the storyline started in Doomsday. So basically SM4 being Doomsday Part 2 and Strange being Secret Wars Part 1 or even a Doomsday Part 3 type of thing, which I think would be cool as a cohesive massive viewing experience following the really fractured feeling of the saga.

Edit: and to add onto this they could include other characters missing in these movies. Captain Marvel, Hulk, Hawkeye, Ms. Marvel, Kate Bishop, Wanda, etc.",Reddit

Another idea. Special Presentations can solve the long gaps between projects. Self contained but yet big 45-minute episode can do a lot for them. Do like 12 and release 1 per month. Focus on side characters and  few main ones. Resolving many loose ends, forgotten characters, etc.",Reddit

Yes, he said that he was mistaken. Things could've been retooled, but I'd doubt it he's too pivotal for the story. The ONLY way that i could see him being sidelined is that he appears at the very end with the TVA to collect heroes in a ""life raft"" of sort to survive the multiversal collapse. 

In Hickman's Secret Wars, Reed built a life-raft and I could see Strange doing that with the TVA and then his movie takes place during A:DD and the ending of both dovetail together to save the heroes. 

Or Strange makes a mistake at the end of his 3rd film and makes a huge sacrifice and just goes to Doom like in Hickman's SW and decides to collaborate with him, collapse the multiverse and then....Secret Wars.",Reddit

Hi, I'm Ricky, and I have a theory about Avengers: Doomsday. Feel free to comment and discuss it. Since we're in the Multiverse Saga, anything is possible. But no one has yet figured out how Tony Stark could have become Dr. Doom. My theory is:

What if it all started with Avengers: Endgame's big battle? Tano's new plan was to destroy the entire universe and build a new one. What if he had achieved this in another universe? His plan wasn't to completely destroy everything like a Big Bang. His actual plan, which he also said, was ""A grateful universe that knows what it has received and not what it has lost."" What if he had restructured the universe according to his ideas, turning Tony Stark into Dr. Doom, for example? But one thing you can't take away from him is his intelligence, which in Doom's case is very similar to Tony Stark's intelligence. He could become a villain either through the invention of time travel, as Tony Stark did, the truth about the deception, or through all the destruction caused by Tanos. But there could also be reasons for him becoming evil in the new universe.

Tano, Tanos, and Thanos... that's probably... ""SNAP!""... (too soon?).",Reddit

If you want a true 1:1 then he should be a cardboard cut out for true comic accuracy. Obviously when something us adapted, it doesn't look spot on or Batman would wear spandex and Daredevil would wear Velvet.

Alan Cumming’s return,"I mean we have a 1:1 example because Nightcrawler was portrayed in X-Men Apocalypse and Dark Phoenix and he looked fine.  I don't know what proportion of that is make up and CGI but it's obviously much less invasive to what they did in X-2.


Nightcrawler is different to represent than Batman or daredevil because it's not the costume that's the issue, he just has different morphology.  Different shaped feet and hands that can't be modeled or emulate with gloves.  He's also covered in a suede like fur that looks void black at certain angles.


And the great part about cummings's portrayal of nightcrawler was less the costuming and effects and more the performance of a competent and well trained actor.  And he's got the chops to pull of some of nightcrawlers very best moments.",Reddit
Alan Cumming’s return,100% agree.,Reddit
Alan Cumming’s return,"> I thought beast looked just fine

I thought he looked like a cartoon. Maybe a decent looking game at best.

>It’s easier to get comic-accurate with some CG

It's even easier if he's a comic. I don't thi k the design is very good anyway but the execution is what I have an issue with. He didn't look like action. Also comic accurate does not mean good.

>that was just a post credit scene for an already way too expensive movi

Maybe, and I hope so.

>Red Hulk looked great in Brave New World

Yes he did. That was a feat of cgi and I wish everything Marvel put out was close to that level. Hopefully a sign of things to come.

>I still have faith that the Russos will be able to crack the story and make a good movie.

Alan Cumming’s return,"I mean, phases 4 and 5 have been really rough. There’s no way around it. It’s been a really bad time as a fan lately.

The cast list from yesterday is just the beginning. They didn’t mention any of the characters that are off world or supposedly retired like Star Lord, or Dr. Strange and Marvel themselves said there’s gonna be more characters. 

Idk I just am really hoping that the Russos can pull this shit together like they said and give us an actual story that’s exciting and fun.

The oddest thing is they included Ghost (a fairly minor character that I’m surprised was in more then one movie never mind three) and M’Baku (who I love but is also a background character in the scale of the MCU) but not Dr Strange, Monica or War Machine who all seem like important characters going forward I feel like they should be in the movie, Also Guardians 3 felt like it was setting up to have Starlord as part of the Avengers with him ending up on earth and it saying he’d return specifically and the fact he hasn’t been named yet is odd 

Most of the rest I feel either won’t appear or will play a very Minor role honestly the young avengers characters shouldn’t appear in doomsday I feel like they deserve they’re own project before showing up in a big team up also I think Spider-Man should not go anywhere near either of these movies unless something changes in Spider-Man 4 hes just been reset to street level hero where he’s getting back to basics and he should be left there for a little while let him deal with less world ending things for a bit 

It dose feel like this Avengers line up is short some heavy hitters so maybe Sam recruits Ross when they need extra muscle or maybe Sentry is on the team so maybe Harrison Ford could show up 

They could also be leaving a lot of these people aside until Secret Wars which honestly is smart as trying to top Endgame on sheer size is going to be difficult but having the Fantastic 4 and X-men show up is probably they’re best bet at coming close to that

There are no Eternals. I won't miss them.

I'll miss Vision and War Machine.

Does the omission of Strange mean Doom won't be a sorcerer?

Chris Evans is retired. (Then again, so was Robert Downey Jr.)

I guess the fate of Spider-Man depends on his next movie. Honestly, that's the one I'm most eager to see.

Natasha Romanoff is still dead (and Scarlet Johansson is super busy).

Fury only had brief cameos at the ends of _Infinity War_ and _Endgame_. (Maria Hill was never a superhero and is also dead.)

Carol Danvers is off-planet? Maybe Kamala Khan is, too?

Barton and Banner: ???

I didn't list Elizabeth Olson as Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch. She's literally dead and buried.

I guess we'll see.",Reddit

Active characters not announced for Doomsday,"Spider-Man isn't isolated in the sense that they don't know him or his existence. They should still know him as an ally. They just don't know that he's Peter Parker. And if they homage the original secret wars, they might throw in something related to him in the black suit which was an iconic moment.

As for the Hulk's, smart Hulk was a member of the illuminati in the lead up to secret wars, so he's important technically, and even disregarding that he is still one of the foremost scientific minds so why wouldn't he be involved  with incursions and she hulk just comes along with him as added muscle, I suppose.",Reddit

Active characters not announced for Doomsday,"A lot are missing, but story-wise, it makes sense to have some focus. Still weird that Monica Rambeau hasn't been announced given that she's seen with the X-Men, and by extension, Carol and Kamala. Especially since the movie needs a bit more female characters! A lot of absents, but story-wise, these are the weirdest omissions.

If someone is omitted from doomsday it could be because they are getting their own film. Maybe some of the leaked concept art is not from doomsday or sw but from this secret film?

Active characters not announced for Doomsday,That Majors audio of him admitting to strangling his girlfriend just leaked like two weeks ago. There's no way he's coming back,Reddit
Active characters not announced for Doomsday,"I think some of the Disney+ and Netflix omissions may be telling to the solution plot in Secret Wars. If we look at Infinity War and Endgame as a fiscal and narrative blueprint then it makes a ton of sense.

   - Whilst being told this set will be different and is ""A beginning"" not an ending. I feel there are enough similar aspects not only in the creative and corporate processes here but also in the current build up. 
   - Characters critical to the overall plot were left out of IW entirely and had their side of the story fleshed out in other movies/media. Specifically Ant Man and Captain Marvel, but I'm looking at you too Clint. This could have been done to save time but it was likely done more to both save budget and build hype for ""part 2"".
   - If we overlay a similay philosophy to IW/EG to DD/SW then odds are DD will be just Act 1 building the main conflict and showing how big the stakes are. With Act 2 being handled by outside media to satiate the audience during the lull between movies like mostly being focused on getting the band back together after DD. And SW being Act 3 with the front half handling the special sock climax and the back half handling the true conclusion and solve. Given the currently announced slate, much like IW/EG there won't be much time to sneak in Act 2.
   - With all that I mind and given what we know about who has been announced, the current and implied statuses of most characters, and what we know about officially announced future projects. I think Act 2 is like going to be focused around the D+ shows where possible as those have more flexibility around production, reshoots, etc. And we are going to see a lot of build around the one character who would really tie both the Avengers and X-men together to a common goal after they have at each other in Battle World. Someone who isn't a member of either team, but had strong ties to both even if she doesn't realize it. She's a Mutant who has loved the Avengers for as long as she can remember and once both teams realize they can trust her and see that she implicitly trusts the other side they will be able to put aside their petty fighting and focus on the real threat together. 
   - In short Kamala Khan is currently the most important character to the future of the MCU and the fact that she's not confirmed for Doomsday along with the other Champions and D+ heroes is very telling to how Secret Wars will likely play out.

Or you know, they finally ran out of that Disney money after paying Stewart, RDJ, and Hemsworth on the same movie.",Reddit

3.  Captain Marvel is a character they've been backing away from.  She was the ""new face of the MCU"" before Endgame, then demoted to co-star with the lowest viewed character and a minor side character, and then lost hundreds of millions at the box office.

Bryan Singer's X-Men may be Doom's first victims when he starts destroying entire universes or something like that.

* Marvel have not announced anything, on a release date that is 11 months away.
* There have been no reports of filming on a mystery or unannounced project. This happens. It happens a lot. Werewolf by Night, for example, was extensively reported on before it was officially confirmed by Marvel. It also happened for the Star Wars show Skeleton Crew.
* Marvel have very publicly said several times there will only be 2-3 MCU films per year, and there are already 2 for next year, plus two slots that could also be used, one of which is less than 12 months away, and one of which isn’t.

Yes, there is always the chance that something is secretly in production and will come out next February. But it seems fairly clear to me that date was reserved a long time ago, and mostly likely fell by the wayside when Spider-man 4 was added as a summer release.",Reddit

my annoyingly long pitch for Avengers Doomsday,Of who you are not sure about I think Doctor Strange will be in there.,Reddit
my annoyingly long pitch for Avengers Doomsday,i do think there’s a chance we will see doctor strange (more likely wong) but i’m unsure since we know we’ll get doctor strange 3 at some point soon and that could very well take place during avengers doomsday. i only say that because insiders are saying spider man 4 will take place during doomsday so that’s why we won’t see spidey in A5. that being said i do hope doctor strange is in A5 because he has a lot of experience with the multiverse so it would only make sense.,Reddit

I also feel like Deadpool isn’t going to fit in with the tone of a serious Avengers movie and honestly I think his story is done same with Wolverine (at least Hugh Jackman) 

Young Avengers are similar to spidey they should probably get their own movie or show to actually team up before throwing them into a multiverse crossover movie

Theres no 'must' about it. It isn't physically possible to have everyone listed playing a major part. Even if the film ran for 3 hrs that's 5min of screen time per 35 announced characters. Some of those announced will have to be no more than cameos and the ones who won't be around moving forward are the most likely to have less screen time.

I definitely think Suri and Shang-Chi are going to join Torres as the new members of Sam’s team, not sure how Thor is going to get involved but he’s an OG so it makes sense for him to be listed as an Avenger same with Ant-Man I count him as an avenger because he was on the Time Heist and they all had uniforms with the A on if that doesn’t count then idk what dose",Reddit

About 40 total characters.  Six had more than 10 minutes.  Seven had 5-10 minutes.  The rest under 5 minutes.

Him being a Stark variant is going to make the most impact on most of the players - and I suspect they're going to do it in a very extreme way ie Doom shows up with some technology/magic combination and everyone is flipping out about Tony being back/alive - only for Doom to kill an Avenger or some other important character and everyone realizes what's going on.",Reddit

I think Strange and Clea will come for SW with Doctor Strange 3 between the films. 

But Midnight Suns, Defenders, Young Avengers, I have no idea. I personally hope they’re kept out because they don’t really work for big multiverse ensembles imo, and can get their own team projects.",Reddit

All the characters in Avengers: Doomsday SO FAR,"Looks like most of the cast is comprised of 4 ""teams""

Xmen

Avengers (or adjacent)

Thunderbolts

Fantastic 4

The leftovers are: Namor, Loki, and Mbaku.

Namor could be looped in with xmen due to his mutant status, or he's just hanging with Mbaku (who could be avengers adjacent with Shuri.) Loki will obviously be a pivotal* character.

We will see.",Reddit
All the characters in Avengers: Doomsday SO FAR,"While I expect several major names have not yet been announced here, it does seem apparent that many of the Disney Plus tier characters will be de emphasized going forward. No Cox, Isaac, Maslany, Vellani, or Stanfeld.

All the characters in Avengers: Doomsday SO FAR,This seems like extreme overkill,Reddit
All the characters in Avengers: Doomsday SO FAR,Cant believe they just spoiled Thunderbolts by telling us who will show up in Avengers,Reddit
All the characters in Avengers: Doomsday SO FAR,"So this cast looks to be nearly exclusively Cap4/Thunderbolts/F4/Wakanda/X-Men, with very few names announced in the cast who's not a part of those movies besides 2 big hitter names with Thor & Loki, 1 tiny name (Ant Man) and 1 street/mystic with Shang Chi.

Some pretty substantial omissions - Captain Marvel, Doctor Strange, Spider-Man, zero Guardians… not to mention not a single Young Avenger nor anyone who’s shown up in a Disney+ series.

As always, I’m excited for this film, crazy stoked for the X-Men, but also can’t help but feel that there’s a side of the Marvel Superhero faction that feels completely absent - the cosmic/mystic side especially, which feels odd since this is Dr. Doom’s movie.",Reddit
All the characters in Avengers: Doomsday SO FAR,"Okay first of all, what the hell?!; secondly i know we have thousands of questions regarding some characters we were expecting but we didn't get. 

I just wanna say I think they have gotten it planned, remember I've been saying this is a 4 part movie event - Doomsday, Spidey 4, untitled movie, Secret Wars. Perhaps now a champions series also. 

So let's wait patiently. Cheers!!!",Reddit
All the characters in Avengers: Doomsday SO FAR,"So here's my take for all the other characters not appearing

Spider-Man is basically forgotten in the universe, so his movie would be the bridging point to bring him in Secret Wars

Doctor Strange should have a good reason for why he's not here, probably he's trapped in the dark dimension

Vision and the young avengers would be appearing in VisionQuest so it makes sense that they're in their own separate mission, I hope Star Lord appears in it as well

Eternals are caught by the Celestials which is still not resolved, so I don't think bringing their storylines here would be any useful

The Hulks, Guardians and all other TV characters are probably in their own separate mission or retired like Hawkeye, which we might know sometime later

Captain Marvel, uhh fighting in a different galaxy, who cares am I right",Reddit
All the characters in Avengers: Doomsday SO FAR,"There a surprising lack of magic people or magic people adjacent in the cast. No Vision, Strange, or any witch is interesting considering how much they’ve been build up the past few years. 

Yes I know Asguardian magic is present but that’s always felt separated from the Wanda’s and Strange’s of the MCU. 

I feel like this isn’t the whole cast or some characters won’t be revealed at all until the movie releases.",Reddit
All the characters in Avengers: Doomsday SO FAR,For an avengers movie I couldn’t be less excited about this,Reddit
All the characters in Avengers: Doomsday SO FAR,"I am really surprised they decided to continue using the original cast for the X-Men as they are all really old now.

All the characters in Avengers: Doomsday SO FAR,"I’m gonna reserve any judgement for the movie itself. You can tell that they definitely pulled back from the Disney Plus stuff, though many speculate those characters will pop up in Secret Wars.

All the characters in Avengers: Doomsday SO FAR,"I'm conflicted on this. Firstly, there's a ton of Fox OG X-Men coming back but they have no relation to Doom nor have played a role thus far in the MCU. Therefore, it feels like more memberberries compared to using the characters they've introduced thus far in the last 3 phases. Secondly, who are the actual Avengers in this lineup since it's mostly composed of Thunderbolts, X-Men, and Fantastic Four characters. Finally, my unpopular opinion is that I've always believed that Doom/Secret Wars should've been the final antagonist/ultimate climax of the MCU before ending it forever. It just feels so rushed for Marvel to pivot from Kang to their biggest storyline/villain.",Reddit

Kinda like how George R R Martin split his cast of over 100 characters across 7 distinct kingdoms, with their own subplots/ensembles, to make it easier to keep track of everybody (rather than having them all together at once)… in fact, I wonder if something like a George R R Martin esque “kingdom split” could be how they’re handling Secret Wars",Reddit

All the characters in Avengers: Doomsday SO FAR,"This is my thought exactly. The characters not present thus far seem incredibly deliberate. There’s basically no magic or cosmic people in the cast unless you count Thor, Loki, and Shang Chi. 

Writing wise it makes more sense to give groups like the Thunderbolts their moment before bringing out characters like Strange, Carol, or Wanda. 

My guess is that this isn’t the full cast, and if it is the full cast we’ll be getting the cosmic/magic side in secret wars. I can imagine Doom beating this set of characters which leads to someone like Thor/Loki escaping to rally characters not announced yet.",Reddit

All the characters in Avengers: Doomsday SO FAR,"Three main Universes(at minimum):  Our 616, the one that the OG X Men(and Monica Rambeau) are in, and wherever Doom is.

Could Doom get involve and offer to help them(by trying to wipe out our 616)? Sure.  But it's not a big deal that they are not currently connected.

  
F4 probably ends showing the consequence of Incursions( with F4's universe dying) which sets up the natural tension and fear for the audience when they get presented with 616 and XMen universe beginning to have an incursion",Reddit

All the characters in Avengers: Doomsday SO FAR,"Not too mention, the profiles of anyone in Thunderbolts will be raised(both the actors and in universe chatacters) once Thunderbolts has released.  It's a nice irony/growth for US Agent to go from that shady role in FATWS to someone who Sam respects/trusts enough to bring into the Avengers.  Unless we think the Thunderbolts are somehow still controlled/manipulated by Val AFTER Thunderbolts film, which I doubt, but if they were, they could also be butting heads with Sam's Avengers",Reddit

All the characters in Avengers: Doomsday SO FAR,"As i said i can see them keeping Jackman being in it a surprise because they want those audience cheers but its weird Cyclops, OG Mystique, frigging Gambit, Nightcrawler and such are revealed but no Storm or Jean or even Rogue. I'm guessing some might be back for Secret Wars instead like how Hawkeye wasn't in IW but was in Endgame. I do think though there's still many they haven't revealed like how Blade, Human Torch and Gambit were kept secret for D&W, hell Laura was meant to be a secret but Dafne Keen really wanted to go to the premiere so they revealed her beforehand.",Reddit

All the characters in Avengers: Doomsday SO FAR,"Halle Berry is definitely interested in playing Storm again. She was also vocal about her mistreatment on X-Men: The Last Stand — the original script began with a big Storm scene where she saves an African village, and they cut it after she officially signed on to the movie. Nevertheless,  she still returned for Days of Future Past almost a decade later.

In 2024, she also expressed interest in appearing in Deadpool and Wolverine, being quoted as saying, “Blake [Lively] asked me one time — I ran into her at a Marc Jacobs fashion show. She said, 'Would you ever be in my husband's movie as Storm?' I said, 'Yeah if he asked me,' but he never asked me.”",Reddit

I personally maintain that the people who throw so much shade about it are the people Stan would have directed that big scathing editorial piece to (the one he wrote back in the time people were angry about Black Panther’s very existence in the comics). Same story, different decade.

All the characters in Avengers: Doomsday SO FAR,Depends on what they do with him. If you don't write any romance or anything it won't be banned.

All the characters in Avengers: Doomsday SO FAR,"That's the only thing I think it can be called. People seem to be forgetting that RDJ got paid 9 figures for this. Half the screen time is his, and it's actually necessary because Doom is a character that NEEDS to be fleshed out",Reddit

All the characters in Avengers: Doomsday SO FAR,"Haha of course, just the implications of daredevil and ms.marvel having dinner together is a bit more than a “small” connection",Reddit
All the characters in Avengers: Doomsday SO FAR,"Right, if Bucky is comfortable and vouches for them, Sam is likely to listen.  And the NYC event that seems to happen in ThunderBolts also seems likely to be a very public event in world, so if they are heroic and save a lot of lives in a way that is obvious and known to the public, that enhances there likelihood of being Avengers Worthy, in universe.

From a MCU Fan perspective, we'll have to see how badass the movie is and which character resonate the most with the general audience.  Very possible for Yelena, US Agent, and RG to all become more popular as characters, even if they are just ""punch and shoot"" heroes vs. having super powers or being trees/raccoons",Reddit

All the characters in Avengers: Doomsday SO FAR,Avoiding spoilers but it was not a reboot. At very least it was a soft reboot in that a total of 3 characters were reconned into 616 and some exotic materials were presented and some of the cosmic order was reshuffled but the other characters stories were mostly continued where they left off with most characters having their memories wiped just like it was during the first Secret Wars.,Reddit

All the characters in Avengers: Doomsday SO FAR,Money Plane.............,Reddit
All the characters in Avengers: Doomsday SO FAR,"Well... a few more than 3. Miles, Jeff, Rio, Ganke, Aaron, Lana, Lana's mom, probably a few other minor characters in forgetting from Miles' corner. Also the Maker.

But I agree with you. It wasn't a reboot. It was falsely advertised as one.",Reddit
All the characters in Avengers: Doomsday SO FAR,"This is actually pretty much what I'm hoping for happening in the MCU. Make it so Mutants were always in 616 and retcon what you need for fresh stories while still keeping old continuity when needed.

We've already seen a taste of what that can look like with Daredevil: Born Again being a soft reboot of the Netflix original.",Reddit
All the characters in Avengers: Doomsday SO FAR,"I expect that if they do in fact start fresh with the MCU after Secret Wars, then they'll do something similar. Many actors who love their roles will return and continue and many past events will be similar but not exactly the same as before so as to fit their new narrative goals (kinda like Daredevil: Born Again, I think?).

This let's everything continue while also not batting an eye at new actors as existing characters, introducing new characters, retconning in the X-Men, and perhaps creating a more fantastical world than previous films allowed.",Reddit

All the characters in Avengers: Doomsday SO FAR,All good shout outs I think in my mind I was counting 3 universes so Miles and his folks so good correction there ahaha,Reddit
All the characters in Avengers: Doomsday SO FAR,"I would be hard money that's exactly what it will be. Mark my words.

I don't have hard money nor do I gamble but you get my point ahahah",Reddit
All the characters in Avengers: Doomsday SO FAR,"Those are exactly my thoughts.

Effectively it gives them a clean slate to go oh yeah this character is now a younger less known actor and this character you never saw before is now everyone's bestie and this villain has been a major threat for years even though we just introduced them and the FF and X-Men have been here all along what do you even mean?

From a studio perspective it gives them the ability to remove stuff that no longer works, refresh certain characters and concepts, take new risks, split up their films and shows into clear distinct genre and styles etc

Their main blockers previous to this was that they were missing some rights, had introduced some characters in eh ways, had written themselves in some corners. I don't personally blame them for that a lot of it was circumstances but now they can just refresh and rewrite it with the gained knowledge of what works and what doesnt",Reddit
All the characters in Avengers: Doomsday SO FAR,"I guess it depends on how you define a reboot.
In comic terms it's ""A reboot usually discards continuity to re-create its characters, plotlines and backstory from the beginning.""

Not the case here at all as it does not discard continuity nor does it restart from the beginning. If anything even those unglued from their past universe are reglued to the new 616 with memories intact.

If you're saying the act of major spoilers >!Franklin, Molecule Man, and the Future Foundation recreating the multiverse via fragments of what remained in Battleworld and new matter!< Is a reboot that's your call but it's not by definition a true reboot as no one had their past discarded or rewritten they were just recreated from their point pre secret wars and ported to this new universe.

It's an important distinction 

As saying it is a reboot misleads the reader to think it's a fresh new beginning. It's not. It starts off right where we left off",Reddit
